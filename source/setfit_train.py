        "The replacement of glass fibres by cellulose‐based fibres in printed circuit board (PCB) is motivated by environmental reasons since the use of biodegradable components from renewable sources will have a significative impact in the life‐cycle assessment and sustainability evaluation of these materials. To study the potential of replacement of glass fibres by natural fibres in printed circuit board manufacturing we have used a finite element method (FEM) computational simulation methodology to evaluate the influence of key structural parameters on their thermomechanical properties, with the goal of predicting and quantifying its warpage at soldering process temperatures. In our work some printed circuit board (PCB) configurations have been selected and modelled using different natural fibres and compared with conventional printed circuit board systems, designated by flame retardant epoxy (FR4), that are made from glass fibres, epoxide resin and copper foils. The simulation results indicate that the printed circuit board assembly process, namely the number of layers, has a major influence on the key thermomechanical properties that were studied. Some optimized printed circuit board configurations were selected, based on the simulation studies, and the natural fibres were classified according to their potential to be used in the development of sustainable printed circuit board materials.",
        "In this study, we utilised prototyping printed circuit boards (PCBs) as a surface acoustic wave (SAW) platform to integrate sensing and acoustofluidic functions and study acoustic wavefield modulation. The PCB is a sandwich structure with a woven glass fibre array encapsulated in an epoxy matrix between top/bottom copper layers. On top of this structure, we fabricated SAW devices by sputtering a piezoelectric thin film (using zinc oxide as an example) followed by patterning metal interdigital electrodes. We demonstrated that the thickness of top copper layer on the PCB, relative to the acoustic wavelength, plays a key role in achieving actuation and acoustofluidic functions. On PCB substrates with copper layers of 35 and 135 ?m thick, we achieved multiple SAW sensing functions, with SAW wavelengths of 220 and 100 ?m, respectively. However, efficient acoustofluidic actuation (e.g., droplet streaming and transportation) was only achieved on the SAW device with a 135 ?m thick copper layer but not on that with the copper layer of 35 ?m thick, because of epoxy's damping of acoustic energy. Additionally, we observed an intriguing phenomenon of SAW field modulation, and the composite structure of glass fibre array and the epoxy matrix led to spatially differentiated attenuation of acoustic energy. The weakened attenuation in the glass fibres and enhanced attenuation in the epoxy matrix resulted in striped patterns of SAW fields on the substrate, parallel to the glass fibres. This means that the SAW field geometries can be flexibly modulated by designing structured substrates to meet diverse application needs. The multi-functional integration and modulation of SAW field geometry, combined with mature integrated circuit process, make PCB-based SAW devices a promising platform for developing future lab-on-a-chip systems.",
        "The rapid growth of the electronics industry has led to a significant environmental impact due to conventional printed circuit boards (PCBs) which contribute heavily to electronic waste. Addressing this issue requires sustainable alternatives that can replace traditional PCB materials without compromising performance. In this study we propose a novel sustainable PCB using banana fiber-reinforced natural fiber composite as the prepreg material combined with biodegradable resin engineered to meet IPC 4101 A/24 standards for fabrication of PCB laminates. The proposed composite exhibits enhanced thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties suitable for low-power applications validated through rigorous testing. To improve the mechanical, thermal and electrical properties we incorporated the 4-bromobenzonitrile functionalized graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanoparticles into the banana composite. This reinforcement has shown a significant augment in flame resistance, dielectric constant and mechanical properties including tensile, flexural, and impact resistance which ensured durability for practical applications. A prototype of the fabricated sustainable PCB substrate was tested with a full-wave rectifier circuit demonstrating effective performance and suggesting its viability as a sustainable replacement for conventional plastic-based FR-1 PCBs in low-power circuits aligning with circular economy principles.",
        "This study presents a novel approach to manufacture a rigid printed circuit board (PCB) using sustainable polymers. Current PCBs use a fossil-fuel-based substrate, like FR4. This presents recycling challenges due to its composite nature. Replacing the substrate with an environmentally friendly alternative leads to a reduction in negative impacts. Polylactic acid (PLA) and Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) biopolymers are used in this study. These two biopolymers have low melting points (130–180 °C, and 170–180 °C, respectively) and cannot withstand the high temperature soldering process (up to 260 °C for standard SAC (SnAgCu, tin/silver/copper) lead free solder processes). Our approach for replacing the PCB substrate is applying the PLA/PHB carrier substrate at the end of the PCB manufacturing process using injection molding technology. This approach involves all the standard PCB processes, including wet etching of the Cu conductors, and component assembly with SAC solder on a thin flexible polyimide (PI) foil with patterned Cu conductors and then overmolding the biopolymer onto the foil to create a rigid base. This study demonstrates the functionality of two test circuits fabricated using this method. In addition, we evaluated the adhesion between the biopolymer and PI to achieve a durable PCB. Moreover, we performed two different end-of-life approaches (debonding and composting) as a part of the end-of-life consideration. By incorporating biodegradable materials into PCB standard manufacturing, the CO2 emissions and energy consumption are significantly reduced, and installation costs are lowered.",
        "During the last several decades, the amount of waste from electronic and electrical equipment manufacturing has grown substantially and as a result, the environmental concerns about this industry have also been increasing. As one of the main branches of the electronics industry, Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) manufactory consumes large amounts of hazardous chemicals and process rinsing water that creates severe pollution load in process wastewater. Within this context, the cleaner production (CP) application through resource conservation and waste reduction at source has been applied for the selected PCB production plant. The prioritized CP options included (a) plasma desmear as a technology modification that eliminates both water and hazardous chemical consumption, (b) lead free coatings as a raw material substitution/conservation option, (c) ammoniacal etchant recovery, (d) microetchant reuse and (e) drag-out recovery by drain board application as on-site recycle/reuse/recovery options. The technical, environmental and economical evaluation of CP options indicated that recommended CP options are feasible investments for the production processes that lead to not only copper recovery but also minimum etchant chemical, electroplating metal and rinsing water consumption. The results also indicated that the implementation of the recommended CP options provide definite decrease in the end-of-pipe treatment (eop) cost. The feasibility analyses were carried out based on the internal rate of return (IRR) values and payback periods of the selected CP options that were grouped into 5-year middle term (options having 1.52 year payback period and 3582% of IRR value) and 7-year long term (option having a 8 year and above payback period and ?13% of IRR value) action plans starting from the year 2007. Two of the proposed CP options, lead free coatings and drag-out recovery by drain board application, have been successfully implemented by the selected PCB plant since the year 2007.",
        "A life-cycle assessment (LCA) was performed on Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) made using the traditional manufacturing approach with FR-4 substrates.

        "Modern life increasingly requires newer equipments and more technology. In addition, the fact that society is highly consumerist makes the amount of discarded equipment as well as the amount of waste from the manufacture of new products increase at an alarming rate. Printed circuit boards, which form the basis of the electronics industry, are technological waste of difficult disposal whose recycling is complex and expensive due to the diversity of materials and components and their difficult separation. Currently, printed circuit boards have a fixing problem, which is migrating from traditional Pb–Sn alloys to lead-free alloys without definite choice. This replacement is an attempt to minimize the problem of Pb toxicity, but it does not change the problem of separation of the components for later reuse and/or recycling and leads to other problems, such as temperature rise, delamination, flaws, risks of mechanical shocks and the formation of “whiskers”. This article presents a literature review on printed circuit boards, showing their structure and materials, the environmental problem related to the board, some the different alternatives for recycling, and some solutions that are being studied to reduce and/or replace the solder, in order to minimize the impact of solder on the printed circuit boards.

It was concluded that the MSS can effectively demonstrate microcontroller experiments and switching applications and it conformed to the required voltage and current ratings, electronics and electrical safety standards. It was also found that it is technically feasible to develop a microcontroller simulator utilizing commercially and locally available materials and spare parts.",
        "The design and optimization of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematics is crucial for the development of high-quality electronic devices. Thereby, an important task is to optimize drafts by adding components that improve the robustness and reliability of the circuit, e.g., pull-up resistors or decoupling capacitors. Since there is a shortage of skilled engineers and manual optimizations are very time-consuming, these best practices are often neglected. However, this typically leads to higher costs for troubleshooting in later development stages as well as shortened product life cycles, resulting in an increased amount of electronic waste that is difficult to recycle. Here, we present an approach for automating the addition of new components into PCB schematics by representing them as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply our approach to three highly relevant PCB design optimization tasks and compare the performance of several popular GNN architectures on real-world datasets labeled by human experts. We show that GNNs can solve these problems with high accuracy and demonstrate that our approach offers the potential to automate PCB design optimizations in a time- and cost-efficient manner.",

        "Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) are critical components in modern electronics, which require stringent quality control to ensure proper functionality. However, the detection of defects in small-scale PCBs images poses significant challenges as a result of the low resolution of the captured images, leading to potential confusion between defects and noise. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework, named ESRPCB (edge-guided super-resolution for PCBs defect detection), which combines edge-guided super-resolution with ensemble learning to enhance PCBs defect detection. The framework leverages the edge information to guide the EDSR (Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution) model with a novel ResCat (Residual Concatenation) structure, enabling it to reconstruct high-resolution images from small PCBs inputs. By incorporating edge features, the super-resolution process preserves critical structural details, ensuring that tiny defects remain distinguishable in the enhanced image. Following this, a multi-modal defect detection model employs ensemble learning to analyze the super-resolved image, improving the accuracy of defect identification. Experimental results demonstrate that ESRPCB achieves superior performance compared to State-of-the-Art (SOTA) methods, achieving an average Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 30.54 surpassing EDSR by In defect detection, ESRPCB achieves a mAP50(mean average precision at an Intersection over Union threshold of 0.50) of 0.965, surpassing EDSR (0.905) and traditional super-resolution models by over 5%. Furthermore, the ensemble-based detection approach further enhances performance, achieving a mAP50 of 0.977. These results highlight the effectiveness of ESRPCB in enhancing both image quality and defect detection accuracy, particularly in challenging low-resolution scenarios.",
        "The structural dynamic performance of printed circuit boards (PCB) directly affects the reliability and stability of onboard electronic equipment in vibration and shock environments. Hence, studying and analyzing the structural dynamic performance of PCBs holds significant importance. In order to address the issue of low computational efficiency resulting from the necessity of establishing a large mesh of elements and considering various boundary and contact conditions in traditional finite element methods, this study comprehensively considers the complexity and variability of PCB structures, encompassing factors such as differing layers, materials, sizes, and irregular component distributions. Through this approach, a more accurate dynamic model of the PCB is achieved. The established PCB model primarily includes equivalent processing of the PCB substrate and onboard components, along with equivalent calculations of various boundary conditions. Ultimately, an equivalent PCB dynamic model is obtained, possessing similar or approximate mass distribution and natural frequency characteristics as the actual PCB, with a deviation less than 6.63%",
        "Though extensive efforts have been invested in developing 3D (3-dimensional) printing processes to produce printed circuit boards (PCBs), the environmental and economic aspects of such processes remain underexamined. To bridge this knowledge gap, we investigate the environmental and economic performances of four 3D printing processes (i.e., fused deposition modeling [FDM], direct ink writing [DIW], inkjet printing [IJP], and aerosol-jet printing [AJP]) for PCB production employing an ex-ante life cycle assessment (LCA) method and a traditional life cycle costing (LCC) method, in comparison with the most widely-used PCB manufacturing process, i.e., the subtractive process. Our findings indicate that in general, the environmental performance of the four 3D printing processes is superior to that of the subtractive process, and substantial environmental benefits occur in the preprocessing stage of the 3D printing processes due to lower energy and material consumptions. However, in terms of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, only FDM is environmentally beneficial, as the carbon emission of this process is less than 40 % of those of the other four processes, while the other 3D printing processes emit more CO2 than the subtractive process. Additionally, only FDM is economically feasible to replace the subtractive process in terms of life cycle cost, as its life cycle cost is merely less than 20 % of those of the other four processes. Again, the life cycle costs of DIW, IJP, and AJP are much greater than those of the baseline due to the high costs of silver inks and AJP printers. The sensitivity analysis underscores the influence of circuit density and thickness on the processes' overall environmental and economic performances. Furthermore, based on the observations, we offer practical implications and research perspectives to facilitate the adoption of 3D printing in electronics manufacturing",
        "End-to-end object detectors based on the Transformer excel at detecting tiny defects on printed circuit board (PCB), but are limited by complex structures and poor generalization. To address the issues, a lightweight framework for PCB surface tiny-defect detection is proposed based on real-time detection transformer (Lite-DETR). Firstly, Lite-DETR designs a lightweight and efficient backbone network (LEBN) to preserve more delicate details and enhance attention to the contextual information of defects. Secondly, Lite-DETR devises an image feature augmentation module (IFAM) to improve data generalization. Finally, the refined cross-scale feature fusion module (RCFFM) is introduced to selectively propagate the information between features, enabling the model to capture multi-scale defect features effectively. At the same time, Lite-DETR employs Intersection over Union with minimum point distance and normalized Wasserstein distance to optimize bounding box matching. Lite-DETR achieves 99.0 % and 99.2 % mean average precision on two different PCB defect datasets, outperforming other advanced defect detection models. Notably, Lite-DETR has a low number of parameters, with only 5.2 million, reducing 74 % compared to real-time detection transformer. The experimental results show that Lite-DETR effectively balances accuracy and complexity, providing a reliable solution for tiny-defect detection in complex industrial environments",
        "Automating recognition the internal defects is a challenge in Printed Circuit Board Assemblies (PCBA). The Computed Laminography (CL) can clearly image the internal structure of PCBA, but the resulting images often suffer from interlayer aliasing artifacts and poorly defined edges, significantly impeding accurate defect identification. Consequently, this paper proposes an end-to-end Enhanced Swin-Condinst (ES-Condinst) network tailored for recognizing internal defects in PCBA. The network replaces the ResNet50 backbone with a Swin Transformer, enhancing nonlinearity and facilitating richer semantic feature learning in the presence of aliasing and weak edges. A sliding window approach is employed for self-attention calculations on small defects, improving the backbone’s capacity for detail feature extraction. Furthermore, the CARAFE upsampling operator replaces traditional bilinear interpolation in the feature pyramid, accelerating inference, this structural modification yields a 6.3 FPS improvement in inference speed compared to the baseline Condinst framework. Finally, an attention-mechanism-guided detection head within the task-sharing module enhances the network’s sensitivity to scale, spatial context, and channel information, mitigating the effects of aliasing and noise. ES-Condinst demonstrates superior accuracy in internal defect recognition compared to state-of-the-art surface defect detection methods, offering a novel approach to automated internal defect identification in PCBAs",
        "The rapid development of deep learning algorithms has enabled effective identification of real and pseudo defects in Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) when sufficient annotated data are available. However, many types of PCBs typically contain unique defect types and circuit specifications and often lack sufficient training datasets for defect detection. Using them to train models with high-precision classification capabilities remains a challenge. In response to these challenges, this study proposes Fully Cooperative Domain Adaptive Neural Network (FC-DANN), aimed at utilizing similar principles for defect recognition on circuit boards of different styles. The FC-DANN model integrates a cyclic feature extractor with a transformation unit and a collaborative discriminator with non-adversarial features. At the same time, a co-quotient classifier composed of multiple single-domain label classifiers is introduced. This method can effectively achieve feature alignment of data with different styles for high-precision, small sample target domain classification. This study use datasets for four PCB styles as well as the public dataset, the efficacy of the FC-DANN model was confirmed. The proposed method has been proven to be effective, with average classification accuracy exceeding 1.06% and 1.88% of existing technologies on both datasets, respectively.",

        "Printed circuit boards (PCBs) are an important component of electronic devices. Therefore, ensuring the quality of such PCBs in the manufacturing process is crucial. Especially, cracks or scratches appearing on the PCB surface pose a significant hurdle, due to their minuscule size, making them the most challenging to address. In this work, we present a real-time automated algorithm for defects inspection of printed circuit boards (PCBs) in different lighting conditions.

Next, the input images are calibrated to match the size and orientation of the template data by the RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) algorithm. Finally, the defective areas on the PCB surface are segmented by using the U-NET (i.e., a type of convolutional neural network (CNN)) model. The proposed algorithm is tested in three different lighting conditions: low light, normal light, and high light conditions. Experimental studies are conducted on a representative PCB to evaluate the defect detection capacity of the proposed algorithm and the experimental results show that the proposed system works well in the three different lighting conditions with an accuracy of up to 97%, the detection speed is 12 frames per second (FPS).",
        "Traditional printed circuit boards (PCBs) cemented carbide drills are manufactured by grinding. With the increasing complexity of PCB materials and the gradual reduction in drill and processing size, higher requirements have been set for PCB drill manufacturing. Issues such as resin adhesion, chip winding, and wear of the cemented carbide drills during PCB drilling result in low drill life and poor hole processing quality. Improvement in drilling performance is limited by structural optimization alone, necessitating the exploration of other enhancement methods.

Laser machining enabled controllable machining and surface friction performance control of different micro-structures on the helical flute surface of cemented carbide drills. Experiments demonstrated that drills with these micro-structures exhibited good drilling performance and significantly improved friction properties. The maximum reduction of axial force during drilling is 8.78 %, the maximum reduction of torque is 56.85 %, and tool wear rate can be reduced by up to 43.75 %.",
        "As a typical e-waste, waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs), are the most valuable and hazardous components containing all the basic and precious metals as well as toxic substances such as heavy metals, brominated epoxy resins (BERs) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs). Due to their high toxicity and carcinogenicity, effective treatment of BERs and BFRs is the key to achieve the environmental-friendly recycling of WPCBs. Recently, catalysis pyrolysis has proven an efficient and promising approach to removing and recovering bromides from WPCBs. The selection of catalysts and pyrolysis parameters mutually affect the debromination of WPCBs including products and mechanisms. However, there are few studies that focus on analyzing and summarizing the above aspects. Herein, this review first introduces types of catalysts (metals, oxides, hydroxides, molecular sieve, etc.) and figures out that metals are regarded as the most suitable catalysts for WPCBs debromination due to their high efficiency and easy to recycle. Then, the interactive effects of catalyst types and pyrolysis parameters on the debromination efficiency are analyzed, and it was found that temperature ranging from 500 to 600 °C, rapid heating rates, small-size samples and in-situ metals were more suitable for debromination. Moreover, a new idea of in-situ catalysis pyrolysis using self-compositions in WPCBs is highlighted, which point out that the defects of catalysts during the reaction process could promote debromination performance. This review summarizes the key knowledge about catalysis pyrolysis debromination from WPCBs, which will devote to the recycle WPCBs more efficiently and environmental-friendly.",
        "Printed Circuit Board (PCB) surface tiny defect detection is a difficult task in the integrated circuit industry, especially since the detection of tiny defects on PCB boards with large-size complex circuits has become one of the bottlenecks. To improve the performance of PCB surface tiny defects detection, a PCB tiny defects detection model based on an improved attention residual network (YOLOX-AttResNet) is proposed. First, the unsupervised clustering performance of the K-means algorithm is exploited to optimize the channel weights for subsequent operations by feeding the feature mapping into the SENet (Squeeze and Excitation Network) attention network; then the improved K-means-SENet network is fused with the directly mapped edges of the traditional ResNet network to form an augmented residual network (AttResNet); and finally, the AttResNet module is substituted for the traditional ResNet structure in the backbone feature extraction network of mainstream excellent detection models, thus improving the ability to extract small features from the backbone of the target detection network. The results of ablation experiments on a PCB surface defect dataset show that AttResNet is a reliable and efficient module. In Torify the performance of AttResNet for detecting small defects in large-size complex circuit images, a series of comparison experiments are further performed. The results show that the AttResNet module combines well with the five best existing target detection frameworks (YOLOv3, YOLOX, Faster R-CNN, TDD-Net, Cascade R-CNN), and all the combined new models have improved detection accuracy compared to the original model, which suggests that the AttResNet module proposed in this paper can help the detection model to extract target features. Among them, the YOLOX-AttResNet model proposed in this paper performs the best, with the highest accuracy of 98.45% and the detection speed of 36 FPS (Frames Per Second), which meets the accuracy and real-time requirements for the detection of tiny defects on PCB surfaces. This study can provide some new ideas for other real-time online detection tasks of tiny targets with high-resolution images.",

In addition, MAN incorporates an efficient attention module to suppress similar background interference. Finally, LDD-Net uses the lightweight decoupling head to detect three groups of shallow feature maps with rich information of the small object. Experimental results on the PCB defect dataset ,and VisDrone public dataset show that the mean average precision (mAP), recall, and precision of LDD-Net outperform state-of-the-art lightweight object detection models. The mAP, computation, number of parameters, and detection speed of LDD-Net are 95.90%, 21.48 G, 5.13 M, and 78.13 frames per second, respectively. LDD-Net effectively balances accuracy, computational cost, and detection speed for applications in edge systems or resource-constrained embedded devices",
        "This study proposes a method to develop an innovative robust fully automatic surface mount technology (SMT) defect detection system using MobileNetV2 with Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). The aim of the system is to detect mounted devices on Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) in real-time with good precision and relatively fast detection speed to improve quality control in the production industry. The design of the proposed system consists of data acquisition, data preprocessing, augmentation, labeling, and the detection model. Data acquisition presents the capturing the data, equipment involved and the setup, while data preprocessing explains the techniques employed to improve the quality of the dataset. To create robustness, the data was diversified and multiplied through the process of augmentation, followed by labeling to mark and tag regions of interest with their respective labels. The MobileNetV2 was utilized lastly, concatenated with FPN and a Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD). The proposed system displays a strong performance with a precision of 97.9%, recall of 96.3%, and F1 score of 97.1%. The detection speed is relatively fast at 33.5FPS with an inference time of 30 ms per image. The proposed detection system demonstrates good performance at a competitive speed, and can detect mounted devices on PCBs in real-time with high confidence.",
        "Reverse Engineering of printed circuit boards (PCBs) has become increasingly critical for quality assurance purposes. Reverse engineering can be accomplished using non-destructive methods such X-ray computed tomography but this faces challenges in terms of the maximum obtainable resolution and the level of details that can be captured from the different materials that are forming the PCB. Destructive methods, which work based on performing consecutive steps of material removal and imaging suffer from a trade-off between throughput and precision/reliability. At one end of the spectrum, use of focused ion beam (FIB) for delayering and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for imaging can offer high resolution 3D images but is prohibitively slow for addressing large regions of interest (ROIs). On the other hand, use of mechanical and chemical methods for delayering can be fast but faces precision, repeatability and reliability issues. We propose a correlative workflow that combines ultrashort pulsed laser for performing controllable and repeatable material removal and digital microscope imaging for information collection, to offer a fully automated PCB reverse engineering process. We showcase the performance of the proposed workflow on a PCB and we validate the results through comparison with X-ray images.",
        "As a chemically resistant hard substrate with surface-mounted metal pads, Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) have the potential to be utilized as substrates for electrochemical applications such as electrochemical microfluidic devices. Compared with regular electrochemical substrates made with glass slides or filter papers, PCB-based substrates have electrode pads with customized size, shape and position, and more wiring layers. Previous works have shown that the PCB-based electrochemical devices can be used as biosensors, electrochemical impedance cytometers, and electrochemical imaging platforms, while their workability as a platform for electrocatalysis has not yet been presented. This work presents a method to develop PCBs into electrochemical substrates for alcohol electrocatalysis and internal reference electrodes. The copper pads were pretreated and electrodeposited with nickel (Ni), silver (Ag), palladium (Pd), and platinum (Pt) for various electrocatalytic purposes. To show the ability of making PCB-based electrochemical devices, two types of PCB-based reference electrodes were made.",
        "This paper proposes a production scheduling procedure for the production lines of a printed circuit board company. Linearity features of the manufacturing process of this company are characterized and exploited for developing an efficient three-phase scheduling procedure. The production line is formulated as a linear job shop that resembles a flow shop. First, the N-gram modelling approach is adopted to analyse the data sets to detect the machines that would be candidates of the bottleneck in the production lines. Second, according to the candidates, the bottleneck data are extracted from the original data sets and solved as flow shops by a mixed integer programming model. The optimal solutions of the bottleneck flow shop is next extended by incorporating upstream and down stream operations to form approximate solutions of the original problems. We propose three different strategies for forming the approximate solutions and the best one is designated as the final solution. The performance of the proposed heuristic algorithm is tested and compared with the well-known NEH algorithm through numerical instances from real production lines. Statistics indicate that for most instances including up to 80 jobs the proposed method delivers competitive solutions within a much shorter time than the NEH algorithm.",
        "Conventional exploding foil initiator (EFI) in ignition or detonation applications hosts many performance advantages, but was hindered by the bulky, inaccurate, inefficient and expensive shortcomings. We highlight a novel micro-chip exploding foil initiator (McEFI) using printed circuit board (PCB) technology. The structural parameters were determined based on energy coupling relationship at the component interfaces. Next, the prototype McEFI has been batch-fabricated using PCB technology, with a monolithic structure of 7.0 mm (l) × 4.5 mm (w) × 4.0 mm (δ). As expected, this PCB-McEFI illustrated the successful firing validations for explosives pellets. This paper has addressed the cost problem in both military munitions and civil markets wherever reliable, insensitive and timing-dependent ignition or detonation are involved.",
        


        "Due to growing concern for the environment, green design methods are used to create products that can reduce resource use and environmental impacts, throughout the entire product lifecycle. In particular, the end-of-life stage of the product lifecycle has received much attention recently. Disassembly sequence planning is one of the major product end-of-life methods, which can be used to increase the reuse rate of components and reduce product environmental impacts. However, total disassembly is usually expensive and impractical. Contrary to total disassembly, this study develops a new partial disassembly sequence planning method. Most prior partial disassembly sequence planning methods did not use life cycle impact assessment tools to perform cost-benefit analyses to find an optimized disassembly stopping point. In this study, Simapro Eco-indicator 99 is used to analyze environmental impacts. The proposed method considers part order, part disassembly directions, number of reorientations, and number of tool changes to find an optimized disassembly plan and an optimized disassembly stopping point. Study results show that the proposed partial disassembly sequence planning method can be used to reduce environmental costs and increase economical benefits, compared to the traditional disassembly methods. Study results also show that the method can help designers redesign the products, make the parts with high economical (recycling) benefits more accessible, and reduce disassembly cost.",
        "Purpose The transition from linear to circular product systems is a big step for any organization. This may require an organization to change the way it does business, designs product and manages supply chain. As these three areas are interdependent, bringing change in one area will influence the others, for instance, changing the business model from conventional sales to leasing will demand changes in both product design and the supply chain. At the same time, it is essential for an organization to anticipate the economic and environmental impact of all changes before it may decide to implement the circular product systems. However, there is no tool available today that can assess economic and environmental performance of circular product systems. The purpose of this research is to develop a multi-method simulation based tool that can help to evaluate economic and environmental performance of circular product systems. Method The conceptual models that are used to develop the tool have been formulated based on review of the state-of-the-art research. System Dynamics (SD) and Agent Based (AB) principles have been used to create the simulation model which has been implemented in Anylogic software platform. Originality This research presents the first multi-method simulation based tool that can evaluate economic and environmental performance of circular product systems. Findings Multi-method simulation technique is useful in designing dynamic simulation model that takes into consideration mutual interactions among critical factors of business model, product design and supply chain. It also allows predicting system's behaviour and its influence on the economic and environmental performance of circular product systems.",
        "The online quality control for reassembly (remanufacturing assembly) process is one of the key technologies to ensure the quality of reassembly influenced by uncertain, nonlinear and dynamic environment. According to the characteristics of reassembly process, this paper constructs the state space model which takes assembly operation and part attributes as the input vector, work-in-process as the state vector, and assembly quality as the output vector. Then, a transfer function for assembly quality is established, which is used to characterize the coupling mechanism of assembly error. Furthermore, considering the uncertainty of remanufactured parts, the modified operation index for reassembly workstation is calculated. On the basis of the studies above, the online quality control method of reassembly is put forward by the grading method. Finally, the online quality control method for the axial clearance and gyroscopic moment of remanufactured crankshaft is studied. The results of the case study indicate that the methods can improve the reassembly precision.",
        "Developing new methodologies for nondeterministic polynomial (NP-hard) problems such as supply chain network design is always a major consideration for academia and practitioners. In this paper a cross-entropy (CE) based solution methodology is developed in order to cope with complex combinatorial problems. The NP-hard problem of designing and planning a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) is considered. Furthermore, a multi-product multi-period CLSC network in a mixed-integer programming structure is regarded. On the other side, cross-entropy is one of the newly developed and successful metaheuristic algorithms. Thus, in order to achieve better solutions in comparison with current solution methodologies, a cross-entropy algorithm is developed for the first time in CLSC design and planning. Then, the capabilities of the cross-entropy algorithm are elevated, in order to achieve solutions that are more robust. Therefore, an algorithm, which is called â€œadvanced cross-entropyâ€ (ACE) is proposed. Finally, two presented CE-based algorithms are compared with a developed genetic algorithm (GA) for the same problem. GA is the most well-known metaheuristic algorithm, which has been abundantly developed in CLSC. Results prove that both of proposed CE-based algorithms dominate current methodologies. Both can find acceptable solutions in comparison with GA. Furthermore, the proposed advanced cross-entropy performs even better than CE in the quality of solutions and time.",
        "Two-sided assembly lines are usually utilized to produce large-sized high-volume products. Recently robots are widely utilized in this line to replace the manual handling and manage the allocated tasks. For a robotic assembly line, the energy consumption is a major expense and the increased energy cost draws much more attentions from manufacturing enterprises. To the best knowledge of the authors, there is no research reported on the energy consumption of two-sided robotic assembly line. This paper presents a new mixed-integer programming model to minimize the energy consumption and cycle time simultaneously. A restarted simulated annealing algorithm is developed to deal with the complexity of the model, which utilizes new local search with three neighbor structures and restart phase based on the crowding distance assignment procedure to obtain well-spread Pareto-optimal set. Testing cases are designed to measure the performance of the proposed method and the restarted simulated annealing algorithm is compared with the fast elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed model is useful to reduce the total energy consumption and the restarted simulated annealing algorithm outperforms the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm in both convergence and spread criteria.",
        "Laser cladding is one of the principal means of equipment remanufacturing and the environmental profiles of this technology has become a research focus. This paper examines the environmental impacts of cast iron cylinder head block remanufacturing through laser cladding using life cycle assessment (LCA), and compares it with the new cylinder head block manufacturing. Resource and energy consumptions of each manufacturing and remanufacturing processes are collected along the production line and then the results of six selected environmental impact categories are calculated. Consistency and sensitivity analysis is also conducted after life cycle impact assessment. The results reveal that cylinder head remanufacturing by laser cladding will achieve large environmental benefits, which can cut environment impact over the entire life cycle by 63.8% on average. This paper also discusses the trend of changes in environmental impacts using scenario analysis over different remanufacturing levels. By taking characterized global warming potential (GWP) as the assessment index, the result shows that remanufacturing will no longer be the preferred option if it needs to repair more than 16 cracks by laser cladding for the cylinder head.",
        "The use of lignocellulosic biomass-based composite materials over petro-materials has received increased attention due to growing environmental awareness, concerns for environmental sustainability, an increasing global waste problem and depletion of fossil fuels. Effective pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass is an important and challenging task for production of engineered composite panels. In the present work, the effect of ionic liquids (ILs) pretreatment on the properties of thermo-molded biocomposite board fabricated from oil palm frond (OPF) lignocellulosic residue and thermoplastic starch (TPS) binder was studied. OPF fiber was pretreated with ILs [bmim][Cl] (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride) and [emim][dep] (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium diethyl phosphate). Mechanical, thermal and morphological properties of the biocomposite board prepared from untreated and ILs -treated OPF fibers were investigated. Moreover, lignocellulosic characterization, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed to understand the effect of IL pretreatment on OPF fiber. It was noted that thermal stability of the biocomposite board was improved as a result of IL pretreatment. Flexural testing evidenced that biocomposite board fabricated from IL-treated fiber exhibited superior strength and modulus compared to that of untreated composite board. The study clearly indicates that IL-assisted pretreatment could be a highly promising and green technology for effective utilization of lignocellulosic biomass in the biocomposite field.",
        "The stability requirement for node enterprises within Ecological Industrial Chain (EIC) has a high degree of functional similarity with the reliability of engineering components. Thus, a methodology for EIC design optimization is established in this study based on the reliability theory. Results showed that series structure had weaker stability than parallel structure. The stability of entire system is reduced with the increase of the number of series, and node enterprises with smaller reliability showed greater contribution to the system stability. On contrary, for the parallel structure, node enterprises with higher reliability had greater contribution to the system stability. To improve the system stability, it is crucial to maintain the weak parts of system or to introduce an appropriate number of â€œspare partsâ€, i.e. to adopt parallel structure and reduce the number of enterprises series. For the parallel structure, priority must be given to those enterprises with higher reliability. Similarly, other constraints (e.g. economic costs and resource constraints) should also be taken into consideration. The redundant design of EIC becomes nonlinear planning decision problems. Novel nonlinear programming model for redundant EIC design is proposed in this study based on the reliability theory, and is effectively verified by means of MATLAB software programming and empirical analysis. Results provide a theoretical basis and practical reference for decision making process of optimizing the design and management of EIC.",
        "Research on integrated products and the closed-loop supply chain design has focused on the competition and coordination of manufacturers and supply chain partners. However, the coordination of supply chain partners for product line design (PLD) with consideration of remanufactured products has not been addressed in previous studies. The present study investigates the coordination of a manufacturer and supply chain partners using a game theoretical model for the design of product lines that contain both new and remanufactured products. A multiobjective optimization model based on Stackelberg game theory is formulated to determine the product line solutions, pricing decisions of supply chain partners, and product return rate for remanufacturing. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II is introduced to determine the Pareto optimal solutions of the multiobjective optimization problems. A case study is conducted on the coordination of a manufacturer, chain retailers, and a remanufacturer for the PLD of tablet PCs with consideration of remanufactured tablet PCs to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methodology.",
        "Particleboard is one of the non-structural wood-based composites developed in the late 1950s in Iran to utilize agricultural and industrial wood residues. Since there was no published document about its Life Cycle Inventory in Iran, the aim of this study was to document the life cycle inventory data from the particleboard manufacturing in the second hand lines in Iran. The study covers the energy consumption and environmental impacts of raw materials and processes during particleboard production. In order to identify the main hotspots and characterize the production process, impact categories were considered using CML methodology and cumulative exergy demand (CExD) indicator. The results revealed that the board shaping subsystem was the main contributor to the most of impact categories. The main hotspot for resin production was known as Urea-formaldehyde (UF). Electricity was the main hotspot in acidification (AC) and ozone layer depletion (OLD) impact categories, while transportation and production process were the main hotspots in marine aquatic ecotoxicity (ME) and photochemical oxidation (PO) impact categories, respectively. Moreover, rotary dryer, hot press, flaker and hammer mill, vacuum pump and diesel fuel were the most effective sectors in the emissions of the production process. Results for substitution of natural gas showed that, except some impact categories, the use of alternative source of thermal energy such as wood residues could improve emissions from the manufacturing process.",
        "Design for Upgradability (DfU) is one of remanufacturing strategies that extend the product lifetime through the functional enrichment of the product. Multiple Life Cycle products (MLPs) are designed with ease-of-upgrade features to allow for product upgrading to be made once the product is not functioning or becomes obsolete. To date, researches on product upgradability have generally focussed on the design features and the attributes of upgradability. However, there have been limited studies on how DfU can be applied concurrently in the product design process with the integration of modelling and optimisation process. This paper is aimed at providing insights on the significance of DfU in product sustainability. A detailed account on the works of earlier researchers that have contributed to the body of knowledge on design upgradability is also presented and discussed. A review on the modelling and optimisation methods commonly deployed in the search for corresponding design alternatives is presented and critically discussed in view of their applicability as tools to choose the best upgradable product design. The paper concludes with suggestions for further research focussing on the tools to enhance design upgradability and their significance in the development of products for multiple life cycles.",
        "Firms face the challenge for ensuring compliance with their corporate sustainability standards (CSS) in their supply chains, i.e. internally, by their suppliers, and also upstream by subsuppliers. Supplier management strategies to ensure compliance with CSS in the supply chain usually focus on suppliers. These strategies fall short when ensuring compliance of sub-suppliers. Firms' sustainable supplier management practices focusing on first-tier suppliers have been studied extensively, while little is known on how firms reach out to sub-suppliers. Firms' challenges include the identification of sub-suppliers, the evaluation of compliance levels, and the execution of corrective action. This study investigates the management of sub-suppliers to ensure sub-suppliers' compliance with CSS of two focal firms in the electronics and retail/food industries using case study research. It focuses on the activities of the focal firm and its perception of sub-suppliers' compliance with its CSS. The findings propose that firms can improve sub-suppliers' compliance with CSS by actively managing sub-suppliers through assessment and collaboration. It was found that (1) public attention on the mediating first-tier supplier, (2) perceived risks of sub-supplier's non-compliance with CSS, and (3) a firm's channel power are antecedents to sub-supplier management. Involving strategic business partners suggests amplifying the positive effect of managing sub-suppliers on sub-suppliers' compliance with CSS. This paper is one of the first studies addressing the management of sub-suppliers from a sustainability perspective. It proposes a framework for understanding sub-supplier management to achieve compliance with sustainability standards, which can also be used for further research and theory development.",
        "The productâ€“service system (PSS) is a system in which its integrated products and services jointly fulfill customer needs. The current research proposes a structured tool called the PSS Board to visualize the PSS process. This is a matrix board where the customer activities, state of the products, services, dedicated infrastructures, and partners are placed in rows, and the general PSS process steps are placed in columns. The visualized PSS on the board shows how the PSS provider and its partners aid customers' job execution process. Previous PSS cases are visualized based on the proposed PSS Board; the utility of the PSS Board is also identified. The current research can serve as an effective basis to analyze PSS from the perspective of fulfilling customer needs, thus supporting companies in diagnosing and elaborating their respective PSSs.",
        "Trajectories of service innovations emanating from manufacturing sectors have been of particular interest to those wishing to improve resource productivity and promote sustainable development. Research has focused on product service systems (PSSs), which are a category of service innovations deliberately designed to offer superior environmental performance. This paper draws on research which explored whether trajectories of PSS can be induced on new UK housing developments to satisfy household demand and prevent household waste. The research was undertaken with a UK speculative house-builder and facilities management service providers from its supplier network. Qualitative data were collected via interviews and focus groups to enable rich accounts of the range of factors in these firms' selection environments which affect receptivity to PSS production to be developed. These were compared with factors affecting receptivity to PSS production identified in a study of UK manufacturers. The results show that in contrast to the manufacturing study, clear drivers for PSS delivery on new housing developments are absent in external selection environments of participating firms and uncertainty associated with the potential of PSS concepts to satisfy household demand inhibits development of requisite competence for PSS delivery within these. Thus further research is needed to explore new PSS supply arrangements involving a range of household service providers.",
        "This paper advocates that a paradigm shift is required in order to improve the performance of the next generation Design for Environment (DfE) tools. Four output mechanisms were identified during the analysis of 22 DfE tools. Further analysis of these mechanisms revealed that the output was focused in one of two ways. In the majority of tools, strategies are prioritised to initiate the output mechanisms, resulting in guidance that is strategy focused and of limited use to the designer. The alternative is to focus on the product under development to initiate the output mechanism. This has the potential to deliver output and guidance that is directly relevant to the product. This paper identifies and discusses the types of guidance provided by DfE tools. The performance of each tool at assisting the user towards a better understanding of environmental issues and improving their ability to generate viable solutions is fully discussed. In summary, this paper explains the background to the study, outlining the research method, and discusses the importance of the findings relative to the future design of DfE tools.",
        " Many companies have begun to implement end-of-use strategies (remanufacturing, recycling, and reuse) in response to worldwide concern about environmental issues. Simultaneously, academic research on remanufacturing has turned to focus on the analysis of activities from a supply perspective, i.e., collection of end-of-use products, reverse logistics, disassembly, assembly, etc. Very little attention has been paid, however, to the demand side of remanufactured products, in particular, to the consumer profile of these products or to determining their most effective marketing strategies. Companies interested and involved in fostering the demand for remanufactured products need to be aware of the importance of knowledge of their potential consumers in order to most suitably manage their remanufacturing and marketing activities. Given this context, the principal objective of the present work was to make a first approach to determining basics characteristics of the profile of potential consumers of remanufactured products. To this end, an empirical analysis was conducted of the key variables underlying the purchase intentions of potential consumers in order to gain insight into the key drivers of that behavior. The instrument used was a questionnaire elaborated for application to potential consumers of a specific product (laptops) in two Spanish universities. The results revealed the drivers that explain the self-declared purchase intention of a remanufactured laptop, and provide managers of firms interested in implementing green initiatives in their supply chain with useful information for their consideration of closed-loop supply chains and for integrating marketing decisions concerning remanufactured products into the development of end-of-use strategies.",
        " The study reported in this paper addresses image board usage and environmental sustainability in the early stages of product development. Simulating the early stages of product development, image boards for three ship interior concepts were created based on different principles for environmentally sustainable design. The boards were used in interviews to elicit feedback on the concepts and to draw conclusions about how consumers make inferences about sustainability. The results of the interviews suggest that consumers infer sustainability from the appearance of interiors in a number of different ways and that image boards can elicit a range of inferences. However, the results also show that the inferences consumers make can differ widely and it is hard to control what inferences they make from an image board. Building on these results, the use of image boards in environmentally sustainable product development is discussed and hands-on advice for their use as an interview stimulus is outlined.",
        " This paper describes the life cycle engineering of an integrated desktop computer system from the perspective of a small to medium enterprise (SME). Using a novel approach which considers the motivations of actors at various stages during the life cycle of the PC it attempts to engineer the lifecycle through design features which have been chosen to influence these critical decision points leading to more desirable pathways from an environmental perspective. Using these motivations it extracts design principles and ultimately design and service features to (1) promote long lifetime with the original user (2) facilitate refurbishment and reuse (3) be easy to disassemble and (4) contain minimal valueless fractions at end of life. This has been achieved largely through two specific design features and supported by post-sale services to the consumer. The first of these features is a high quality finish using a solid hardwood chassis to create an emotionally durable product that is easy to refurbish and eliminates negative value plastic fractions at end of life. The second feature is a strong focus on ease of disassembly to facilitate upgrade, refurbishment and deep disassembly at end of life. The service offering is also crucial and upgrade services and buy back are available.",
        " As closed-loop production becomes an increasingly viable strategy for product life cycle management, cost modelling and analytical tools for closed-loop production systems will become increasingly important. Existing tools based on life cycle costing (LCC) methods are lacking an integrated life cycle perspective in their approach â€“ a perspective that cannot be overlooked when modelling closed-loop production systems. In this paper, we aim to solve this lack of integrated life cycle approach by proposing the product structure-based integrated life cycle analysis (PSILA) technique. It allows us to streamline the process of modelling a closed-loop production system for a complex product based on its product structure. Through this technique, we developed a cost model of a closed-loop production system for a flat-panel (FPD) monitor case study. In this case study, the results simulated by the cost model show an increase in the economic performance when closed-loop production is adopted for the FPD monitor. Deeper analysis of the results in the case study indicate that in order to improve the economic performance of the closed-loop production system for the FPD monitor, the best strategy is not to merely focus on the reutilisation of materials. Instead, the option to remanufacture the FPD monitor for the secondary market should be explored to maximise the value reclaimed from the monitors in the EoL phase. The case study demonstrates that the cost model developed through the PSILA technique has the ability to function as a tool for analysing the economic performance of closed-loop production systems. More importantly, it has the ability to provide us with strategic insights on the cost feasibility of adopting closed-loop production strategies.",
        " The promise of product and design analytics has been widespread and more engineering designers are attempting to extract valuable knowledge from large-scale data. This paper proposes a new demand modeling technique, Demand Trend Mining (DTM), for Predictive Life Cycle Design. The first contribution of this work is the development of the DTM algorithm for predictability. In order to capture hidden and upcoming trends of product demand, the algorithm combines three different models: decision tree for large-scale data, discrete choice analysis for demand modeling, and automatic time series forecasting for trend analysis. The DTM dynamically reveals design attribute pattern that affects demands. The second contribution is the new design framework, Predictive Life Cycle Design (PLCD), which connects the DTM and data-driven product design. This new optimization-based model enables a company to optimize its product design by considering the pre-life (manufacturing) and end-of-life (remanufacturing) stages of a product simultaneously. The DTM model interacts with the optimization-based model to maximize the total profit of a product. For illustration, the developed model is applied to an example of smart-phone design, assuming that used phones are taken back for remanufacturing after one year. The result shows that the PLCD framework with the DTM algorithm identifies a more profitable product design over a product life cycle when compared to traditional design approaches that focuses on the pre-life stage only.",
        " Many problems such as health and environment issues are identified with the use of flood cutting fluids in machining processes. Considerable attention has been given to reduce or completely omit the cutting fluids, and meet the demands for environment-friendly cutting processes. In this study, the effects of cutting speed and undeformed chip thickness on cutting and feed force components and tool tip temperature were experimentally investigated in order to remove cutting fluid. AA5083-O wrought alloy with a high Mg content (4.5%) was machined in dry and wet machining conditions utilizing coated carbide tool. Two-factor (cutting speed and undeformed chip thickness) and five-level fractional experiment designs completed with a statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed. Mathematical models for cutting and feed force components and tool tip temperature were developed using the Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Results show that the output variables are significantly affected by the undeformed chip thickness. On the other hand, in the high cutting speed and low undeformed chip thickness, AA5083 can be machined without cutting fluid. Also, both cutting speed and undeformed chip thickness have statistical significance on the cutting and feed force components in dry and wet machining. Finally, the appropriate ranges for the optimal turning conditions were proposed for industrial production.",
        " With the excess consumption of resources and the deterioration of the environment, machine tool remanufacturing is paid more and more attention for its enormous economic and social benefits. Based on the analysis of the industry development status of machine tool remanufacturing in various countries, it is pointed out that the machine tool remanufacturing industry mainly consists of OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) of machine tool, third-party remanufacturers and manufacturers of NC (Numerical Control) system. Due to the advantages of OEMs of machine tool in brand, technology, talented persons and logistics, it may be the main body of machine tool remanufacturing industry in China. Combined with the development characteristics of this industry, three industry models of machine tool remanufacturing by OEMs are analyzed, including recycling-based machine tool remanufacturing, solution-based machine tool remanufacturing and trade-in machine tool remanufacturing. The solution-based industry model of machine tool remanufacturing would be the most promising one for the OEMs and the users. In addition, the economic and environmental benefits of machine tool remanufacturing are analyzed with a case study of production line upgrading solution for gear based on machine tool remanufacturing by OEMs.",
        


        "Electronic wastes containing metallic and nonmetallic hazardous materials, if left untreated, are severely harmful to the environment, social, ecosystem, and human well-being. In this study, the effects of substituting recycled electronic waste, i.e., printed circuit board (PCB) dust, and fly ash (FA) concurrently as a partial replacement of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) in self-compacting concrete (SCC) was investigated to explore a novel electronic waste recycling method and new material of construction. The decisive parameters of e-waste mixed cement SCC are workability characteristics and hardened properties. According to the design of experiments, the ratio of PCB dust waste in OPC were 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 30% whilst the ratio of FA in OPC were 10%, 20%, and 30% by volume. Workability characteristics were verified by means of rheological behaviors, i.e., slump diameter, T500 flow time, test V-funnel test, J-Ring test and L-box test. Compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength, and ultrasonic pulse velocity up to 180 days were determined for its hardened properties. According to the result, recycled PCB dust with FA can be used as cement replacement for SCC. Combining use of recycled PCB dust and FA as filler and pozzolanic synergistically yielded satisfactory results, e.g., greater than 60 MPa of compressive strength at 28 days for 5% PCB dust and 10% FA. In addition, compressive strength at 180 days of highest cement replacement level at 60% was greater than 40 MPa. Eventually, there are opportunities to use combined PCB dust and FA as cement replacement in SCC which yields cost saving and eco-sustainable SCC products that are economically and environmentally beneficial for the construction industry.",
        "The rapid increase in electronic waste (e-waste) generation and its unsustainable management pose a threat to the environment and human well-being. However, various valuable metals are present in e-waste, which makes it a potential secondary source to recover metals. Therefore, in the present study, efforts were made to recover valuable metals (Cu, Zn, and Ni) from waste printed circuit boards (WPCB) of computers using methanesulfonic acid (MSA). MSA is contemplated as a biodegradable green solvent and has a high solubility for various metals. The effect of various process parameters (MSA concentration, H2O2 concentration, stirring speed, liquid to solid ratio, time, and temperature) was investigated on metal extraction to optimize the process. At the optimized process conditions, 100% extraction of Cu and Zn was achieved, while Ni extraction was around 90%. The kinetic study for metal extraction was performed using a shrinking core model and findings showed that MSA-aided metal extraction is a diffusion-controlled process. Activation energies were found to be 9.35, 10.89, and 18.86 kJ/mol for Cu, Zn, and Ni extraction, respectively. Furthermore, the individual recovery of Cu and Zn was achieved using the combination of cementation and electrowinning, which resulted in 99.9% purity of Cu and Zn. The current study proposes a sustainable solution for the selective recovery of Cu and Zn from WPCB",
        "As a byproduct of electronic waste, the accumulated millions of tons of nonmetals from waste printed circuit boards (referred to hereinafter as NPCB) have caused severe environmental issues. Here, we report a novel method for the production of wood composites reinforced by NPCB via a solid-state shear milling (S3M) process. The S3M pretreatment successfully exfoliated NPCB into single glass fibers with a high aspect ratio. Hemicellulose and lignin were liberated from the surface of the wood cellulose fibers, and the size was reduced to a submicron level. Both optical and electron microscopy revealed that the wood composites prepared by the S3M process exhibited excellent filler dispersion and excellent interfacial adhesion between the filler and the polymer. This NPCB-reinforced wood composite was thermally stable at temperatures below 200C. In addition, the exfoliated NPCB and wood flour provided a well-designed structure that improved the tensile strength of the composite to 32.4 MPa. This wood composite retained a high storage modulus of 616 MPa at 100C, expanding the upper service temperature limit for wood composites. The excellent interfacial adhesion and hydrophilic nature of NPCB led to water absorption as low as 0.21%, exceeding the values previously reported for NPCB-reinforced wood composites under the same conditions. Finally, this wood composite also contained negligible organic pollutants and low heavy-metal concentrations, which are far below the regulatory limits for hazardous waste. The above results show that the reuse of NPCB in high-strength wood composites is a promising choice for both resolving environmental pollution and reusing solid waste to create value-added products.",
        "To establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for copper recycling from waste printed circuit boards (PCBs) through integrated chlorination roasting and molten chloride electrolysis, the electrochemical behavior and kinetic characteristics of Cu(I) on W electrode were systematically investigated in eutectic NaCl-KCl system at 700C. The findings reveal that Cu(I) undergoes direct reduction to metallic Cu via a reversible electrochemical process controlled by diffusion, and the copper electrodeposition process follows a progressive nucleation mechanism. The equilibrium potential, apparent electrode potential, Gibbs free energy change and exchange current density for the Cu(I)/Cu redox couple were determined over the temperature range of 700-800C, with the activation energy of the reaction calculated as 28.16?kJ mol?1 and 26.23?kJ mol?1 using Tafel analysis and linear polarization methods, respectively. The negative enthalpy change thermodynamically confirms the exothermic nature of the Cu(I) electrochemical reduction to metallic copper. XRD and XPS analyses conclusively confirm that Cu(I) can stably exist in the molten salt system. Potentiostatic electrolysis was performed at ?1.0?V in molten NaCl-KCl-1.0?wt%CuCl system, and after 2?h of electrolysis, red sponge metallic Cu with a purity of up to 99.97?% was extracted. This work verifies the technical feasibility of direct molten chloride electrolysis for extracting high-purity copper from the chlorinated intermediate CuCl, affording theoretical guidance and technical roadmap for cleaner and efficient recycling of copper from waste PCBs.",
        "The utilization of electronic devices has been consistently increasing each year. In the fiscal year 2020-2021, India handled more than 340,000 tonnes of electronic waste, a significant surge from the 69,414 tonnes recorded in 2017-2018. Over the past four years, there has been a remarkable fourfold increase in the collection and processing of e-waste. This project focuses on e-waste generated from headphones, considering their widespread usage globally. Surprisingly, despite their ubiquity, only 15 % of headphones are recycled, with more than 85 % being discarded as waste. To address this issue, hydrometallurgy treatment is employed to extract valuable metals such as copper and iron. Following this treatment, this research successfully obtained copper carbonate and iron oxide as essential elements. The leached solution undergoes analysis using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS). Further characterization through X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) of batteries and magnets aids in identifying the crystalline materials. Additionally, a cost-benefit analysis was carried out, revealing a 57 % and a 39 % profit in copper carbonate and iron oxide extraction respectively and this validates the confirmation of circular economy. Finally, a questionnaire survey was conducted with approximately 192 students, revealing that most headset replacements occur roughly once a year, typically within a budget of around Rs. 500 - 1000. This strongly indicates a high rate of waste disposal.",
        "Rare earth elements (REEs) are among the important elements in various high-technological appliances globally. Recently, the recovery of REEs from the waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) has gained significant interest for the sustainability of global electrical and electronic industrial markets. The fast-evolving and rapid changing of technology has made many of these hi-tech equipment become obsolete with high disposal rates. Rising concerns over the depletion of REE sources have led to the need to extract and recover the REEs from WEEE. However, many studies still need to be carried out to optimize the recovery processes of the REEs in terms of the extraction methods employed and to minimize the environmental impact and hazard towards the flora and fauna. This review outlines the various REEs available in a wide range of electrical and electronic equipment, the various types of REE recovery methods, as well as their environmental impacts. The future perspectives and research directions in terms of the circular economy, policy and regulatory framework and research roadmap for REE recovery from WEEE are also discussed.",
        "Innovations in technology are crucial to the survival of modern society. As a result, the output of electronic garbages (E-wastes), which contain recyclable and reusable components, has significantly increased. Electronic waste represents a significant environmental challenge which is rapidly intensifying on a global scale. Batteries and used printed circuit boards are examples of e-waste that can be recycled. The current scenario to recycle electronic waste severely needs the environmentally friendly and resource recovery methods. The study of alternate inputs for nanoparticle manufacturing as well as the application of green synthesis methodologies is driven by the area of materials science and engineering’s growing interest in enhancing the sustainability of the processes involved in their manufacture. Recovered metals can be used for a variety of purposes and one of them is as a great substitute source for making nanoparticles at a low cost. Finding a less expensive substitute precursor is crucial since it enables the commercialization of numerous uses for metal nanoparticles. Every year, tonnes of technological goods are transported across oceans, which degrade into complex trash after use. More than 75% of e-wastes are unsure of their purpose or trying to find ways to be used, such as refurbishing, remanufacturing and parts reusability for repair. The generation of e-wastes from large household appliances represents the largest proportion of waste, followed by information and communications technology equipment and consumer electronics. The purpose and significance of recycling e-wastes for the recovery of nanomaterials, as well as prospective uses for producing renewable energy, are covered in this review.",
        "Separating precious metals (PM), including gold (Au), silver (Ag), and palladium (Pd), from secondary sources, such as end-of-life products, may aid industrial sectors, spanning from electronics and automotive industry to catalysis and renewable energy, in meeting their increasing metal needs. Sustainable, eco-friendly nanotechnology may provide a viable alternative to conventional separation practices, such as solvent extraction, mitigating their environmental footprints. Here, we nanoengineer cellulose pulp to yield cationic hairy cellulose nanocrystals (CHCNC), bearing a high density of quaternary ammonium groups (? 2 mmol g?1), to selectively remove the PM from Au-Ag-Pd ion mixtures and the complex leachates of waste printed circuit boards (WPCB). Au is recovered via the CHCNC-enabled electrostatic attraction and reduction reaction within seconds at a recovery capacity (qe) of up to ? 772 mg g?1. Immobilizing CHCNC on microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) via a mussel-inspired nanocellulose coating (MINC) yields mussel-inspired cationic nanocellulose-coated MCC (MINC+), which recovers Pd via electrostatic interactions within hours at qe up to ? 559 mg g?1, and Ag is stoichiometrically recovered using chloride ions. Furthermore, a multi-step batch process is developed to selectively recover Ag, Au, and Pd from the WPCB leachates. CHCNC-enabled sorbents may pave the way for developing advanced bio-based, sustainable materials for selective elemental recovery at industrial scales, promoting circular",
        "The possible optimization of metal recovery from Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) and Central Processing Units (CPUs) has been investigated. Usual practice is to recover primarily the metals with the highest market price. In contrast, the present work shows how strategic considerations of the value share (%) of metals content and data regarding the environmental impact of their recovery can instruct about the best strategies to adopt, pointing at the metals to be recovered as a priority depending on the case. An accurate PCBsâ€™ characterization carried out through microwave digestion with a mixture of HNO3, HF and HCl, is a first essential step of the procedure. Then, metals are recovered through chemical leaching with different chemical substances, exploiting both chemical and physical steps. A proposal is presented to improve the environmental and economic sustainability of the treatment of PCBs, which provides for the initial recovery of Cu, Pb and Sn from the whole boards, through leaching with 6M HNO3, followed by the recovery of gold and other precious metals from the board components once removed and appropriately crushed. Although unusual, the recovery procedure can be adapted accordingly, allowing greater profits, easier management and higher metals recovery rates.",
        "Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE or e-waste) has emerged as a formidable global waste stream, reflecting the mounting demand for technology in our interconnected world. Over the past two decades, besides a world facing a rapid digital, e-mobility, and green energy transition, there has been a growing recognition across the globe, among both society and industries, regarding the hazards and opportunities linked to e-waste management. This collective consciousness has driven the adoption of best practices, including the implementation of circular economy (CE) models, fostering environmentally sustainable production and recycling processes. With a rate of around the 72% of the global population (81 countries) reached by specific regulations by 2023, this review explores the evolving landscape of international legislation and emerging technologies designed for e-waste prevention and valorization, emphasizing low-environmental impact and sustainability. Despite a prolific scientific community (papers published on e-waste grew over 1000 times in the period 2002â€“2022) and the rise in good practices in different countries, the modest increase of innovation patents (rate of around 50% increase) and the limited number of industrially established innovation processes demonstrates that while the advancing technologies are promising, they remain in an early, embryonic stage. This paper offers a concise review of life cycle assessments from existing literature to underpin the technological advancements discussed. These assessments provide insights into the reduced environmental footprint of various innovative processes aimed at enhancing the circular economy and incorporating them into the emerging concept of safe- and sustainable-by-design. Meanwhile, global e-waste production rose from an estimated 34 Mt in 2010 to 62 Mt in 2022, while documented proper collection and recycling only increased from 8 Mt to 13.8 Mt over the same period. This shows that e-waste generation is growing nearly five times faster than formal recycling. Furthermore, if waste management activities remain at 2022 levels, a projected economic (benefit â€“ costs) deficit of 40 billion USD is expected by 2030. It is time for communities to reverse the trend by expanding good practices and implementing technology-economic-environment sustainable and efficient circular economy models. In the framework of e-waste management regulations, synergistic green chemistry & engineering are powerful in addressing a sustainable circular economy.",

        "Aircraft that take off and land verticallywith rotors or horizontal propellers like drones use more energy than conventional aircraft whose lift is provided by wings. Drones with propellers are less efficient than helicopters with large rotors. The poor energy density of batteries compared to hydrocarbon fuels limits the range and endurance of the electrically powered aircraft. Although the ratio of the mass of payload and fuel (or battery) to the total aircraft mass for the proposed Amazon drone is not that different from the same ratio for a Boeing 747, the range and time in the air is very much less. In principle, a conventional aircraft powered by photovoltaic panels covering a wing with a span of 6 m could match the performance of the proposed Amazon drone. Amazon has proposed delivering packages by an electrically powered drone capable of vertical take off and landing. By comparison with helicopters, the energy needed to move a 2.5 kg package is estimated to be more than 130 times the energy used in delivering the same package in a small delivery truck. By comparison, a conventional airplane with the same mass could, in principle, be powered by photovoltaic panels, covering the wings, and it would use an energy equivalent to about 3 times the energy used by a small delivery truck. Based on the performance of existing small helicopters, the analysis shows that an electrically powered air taxi would only be able to make journeys of 10 min or less. Vertical take-off and landing add to energy requirements, and drones using a large number of propellers are less efficient than helicopters. The major limitation, not surprisingly, is the poor energy density of batteries compared to liquid hydrocarbon fuels.",
        "Energy storage devices are necessary for a Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES) because of the varying power output of solar photovoltaic (PV) modules caused by fluctuating sunshine intensity. Since they guarantee a steady and dependable flow of electricity across the grid, batteries play a crucial role in stabilizing the energy supply. The technical, financial, and environmental advantages of combining batteries with PV systems are highlighted in this paper. These advantages include less CO2 emissions, improved energy stability, and cheaper grid operating costs. Proper placement, sizing, and design of PV units can maximize these advantages, promoting sustainable energy production compared to traditional renewable energy sources (RES). The paper also evaluates the progress in PV and battery technologies, alongside the challenges of integrating them with grid systems in electric power networks, emphasizing their critical role in reducing environmental impacts and advancing energy sustainability. The study further investigated 11 HRES configurations using HOMER Pro to analyze cost optimization, energy distribution, and renewable energy integration. Cases 1 to 4 relied solely on grid power, delivering stable electricity with zero unmet loads but emitting 2593 to 2599 kg of CO2 annually, with renewable fractions (RF) below 0.3 %. Adding PV systems and batteries in Cases 5 to 8 reduced emissions to 2441 kg/year and increased RF to 6.1 %, but operational and replacement costs raised the Net Present Cost (NPC). Off-grid configurations (Cases 9 to 11) achieved 100 % renewable energy, eliminated CO2 emissions, and significantly improved energy efficiency (EE). However, these configurations incurred higher NPC and operational costs due to increased reliance on PV systems and batteries. The findings highlight the need to advance hybrid renewable energy systems while striking a balance between economic viability and environmental sustainability.",
        "Lithium-ion battery energy storage system (BESS) demonstrates great potential to provide inertia support to the power grid. The balance between the efficient inertia support and secure operation of battery is challenging, which requires accurate estimation of battery output boundary, especially in online working conditions. However, the existing methods for assessing the output power boundary of battery usually ignore the special inertia-supporting output profile and the requirement for online application, limiting the accuracy and efficiency. This paper proposes a novel online estimation method of inertia-supporting sustaining power boundary (SPB) of BESS based on model-data fusion method (MDFM). First, a series of experiments are conducted to investigate the impedance characteristics of battery under inertia-supporting condition, based on which a negative resistor-based equivalent circuit model (ECM) is developed to involve the nonlinear solid-phase diffusion effects of battery. Recognizing the nonlinear impact of state of charge (SOC) and discharge current rate on the negative impedance, a support vector machine (SVM) is applied to model the negative impedance, where the experimental results are input as the training data. Then, an MDFM-based method is proposed for online parameter estimation of the improved ECM, where the negative impedance is estimated by the SVM in real-time. Based on the ECM, the inertia-supporting SPB of BESS, constrained by the cut-off voltage, SOC and maximum current thresholds, is estimated online by a multi-constraint-based method. Finally, experiments are conducted to validate the MDFM-based ECM estimation method and the multi-constraint-based online SPB estimation method. Compared to conventional peak power estimation methods, the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy of BESS's output boundary assessment in an online manner.",

        "There is a drive to reduce fossil fuels dependence of society through the implementation of eco-friendlier renewable energy generation systems. However, the energy generated from renewable sources must be properly managed to guarantee the daily energy supply in different scenarios and conditions. To achieve that, energy storage systems, such as electrochemical batteries, can be implemented due to their high performance. Lithium-ion batteries are widely used energy storage systems for a variety of applications including smartphones, laptops, electric vehicles, or home storage systems. However, an increasing dependence on this technology will also lead to an increasing demand for lithium and other materials required for battery manufacturing, placing pressure on environmental issues that modern society faces nowadays and on the policies regarding decarbonization and reduction of greenhouse gases emissions.

        "Battery energy storage is evolving as an increasingly feasible alternative for self-supported solar power systems in the Levant region, with lead-acid batteries recreating a significant role among the available energy storage solutions. However, these batteries deteriorate over time, influencing their lifespan and performance. This analysis examines the regeneration of a 24-cell bank of 2 V 300 Ah GFM lead-acid batteries. The 2 V cells were reconditioned and assembled into a 48 V battery bank with a comparable 300 Ah capacity through a managed experimental procedure. The outcomes show the effectiveness of the patented regenerative approach, which integrates constant potential, constant current, quick charge, and pulse charge methods. This technique significantly extends battery life by effectively dissolving lead sulfate deposits, balancing cell discrepancies, and restoring battery performance. These findings spotlight the potential of advanced battery reconditioning techniques for extending battery lifespan and improving performance, supporting more sustainable energy storage solutions in solar applications. Finally, the results indicated that the battery voltage of the battery under test was increased by 2.4 %, and its capacity recovery was increased by 2.2 %",

This review provides an in-depth examination of the progress in electrode materials, highlighting traditional lithium-based options such as lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2), lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), and high-energy lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC). The focus then shifts to promising lithium-free alternatives which utilize more abundant elements and offer potential improvements in specific capacity, stability, and environmental impact. Key methodologies for calculating performance parameters, such as specific capacity, energy density, and capacity fade analysis, are also discussed.

        "Condition monitoring and state of health estimation are crucial for ensuring the secure operation of lithium-ion batteries. To address the difficulty in thoroughly capturing the changes in the state of the partial charging and discharging processes of the battery and the high demand for real-time performance of battery condition monitoring, a method for online condition monitoring and state of health estimation of lithium-ion batteries based on time-ratio features from the whole process is proposed. The health features are derived from the batteryâ€™s full charging and discharging curves, and the correlation methodology is used to analyse the relationship with the state of health. The proposed random forest-based online condition monitoring model and gated recurrent unit-based state of health estimation model are conducive to timely monitoring abnormal conditions and accurate estimation to ensure safe battery operation. Finally, the proposed method can realise accurate and real-time online condition monitoring with a classification accuracy of more than 0.93 and running time of less than 0.2 ms, and achieve better performance of state of health estimation under different ambient temperatures, with a root-mean-square error of less than 0.02 at room temperature and less than 0.01 at 43 Â°C.",
        "The heat accumulation of lithium-ion batteries is a crucial factor influencing their performance. Excessive heat production can cause thermal runaway, heightening the risk of fire or explosion. Understanding the mechanisms of heat generation and transfer is vital for implementing effective thermal management strategies. Moreover, effective thermal management is imperative for sustaining the optimal operating temperature and performance optimization of the battery. This work systematically explores the intricate heat processes inside the batteries, encompassing heat generation, transfer, and dissipation. A critical analysis of heat generation mechanisms is presented, followed by a discussion of specific calculating models. A detailed description of various heat transfer mechanisms is provided and calculation models for temperature distribution inside the battery across different application scenarios are summarized. The strategies and advancements in thermal management for batteries are further evaluated, addressing both active, passive, and hybrid approaches, and the integration of innovative materials and technologies. Finally, the current challenges and prospects related to heat generation, heat transfer, and thermal management are also discussed. This work not only presents a comprehensive and systematic overview regarding the generation, transfer, and dissipation of heat in lithium-ion batteries but also provides valuable insights for professionals involved in research on heat generation and thermal management.",
        "With the expansion of the lithium ion (Li-ion) battery market, new materials for lithium ion cathodes are constantly being developed. Especially automotive applications require a decrease in production costs, which often means to increase the content of less expensive metals. However, these composition changes also affect the cathode properties and may also require considerable changes in the processing conditions. There are still considerable gaps regarding life cycle inventories for cathode materials as the availability of commercial process data is limited. The presented study had two main objectives: (1) quantifying the natural resource use for the production and recycling of five cathode materials for Li-ion batteries in a closed loop scenario based on data directly provided by industry and (2) assessing the impact of differences in composition, cathode material properties and production technology. An exergy-based method was employed to assess the cumulative resource use. To get a better view on the impact of the property differences of the cathode materials, resource consumption was expressed per kg, per kWh one cycle and per kWh over the cycle life. The latter was the actual functional unit. The results per kg of cathode were comparable for all (290â€“346MJex/kg) but one (622MJex/kg) of the cathode materials. Metal supply and energy use during cathode material production were the main drivers of natural resource use. Due to the diverging characteristics of the cathode materials the relative results in terms of the functional unit (0.39â€“0.70MJex/kWh) differed considerably from the results per kg of cathode material. For example, while the resource use for one of the cathodes was relatively high per kg of material, it was similar to the resource use of two other cathode materials per kWh (cycle life). This implies that it is not sufficient to have good process data to compare the resource consumption of different cathode materials. The properties of the cathode materials, respectively the battery as a whole, have to be carefully determined in function of the application. Two of the cathode materials were developed with the target to reduce cost of feedstock metals while maintaining performance. Indeed, those two cathodes showed low resource use per kg (290â€“343MJex) and per kWh (one cycle) (377â€“463MJex).",
        "The exergetic efficiency of the thermal management system (TMS) in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) has great importance since the supply of available energy onboard is limited, and that the efficiency is closely tied to the overall environmental impact of the vehicle. Thus, it is imperative to have a good understanding of the thermodynamic irreversibilities and environmental impact associated with the system and its components. In this paper, exergoenvironmental analysis is conducted on hybrid electric vehicle thermal management systems. In the exergy analysis part, the balance equations are written for each system component of the TMS to determine exergy destruction rates and exergy efficiencies of the system and its individual components. In the environmental analysis part, a life cycle assessment (LCA) is carried out (using Eco-indicator 99 points) and environmental impact correlations are created in order to obtain the environmental impact of each relevant system components and input and output streams. Consequently, exergoenvironmental variables are calculated, and exergoenvironmental evaluation is performed to determine the most environmentally friendly system components and provide information about trends and possibilities for design improvements. Based on the analysis, it is found that the electric battery has the highest environmental impact in the system due to the copper used in the anodes and gold used in the integrated circuits which accounts for over 40% and 26% of the overall impact respectively.",
        "This paper describes the operational concepts and system requirements of a fully automated electric bike (e-bike) sharing system demonstrated through a pilot project at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK) campus (deployed in September 2011). This project is part of a movement to develop a sustainable transportation system, and is one of the green initiatives on UTK campus. E-bikes are more energy efficient and produce fewer greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per person compared to other transport modes such as car, bus, and motorcycle. Without empirical demand information for an e-bike sharing system, we simulated the operations of such a system to gain insights during the design process before field deployment. The simulation exercise focused on three critical demand parameters â€“ distributions of trip rates, trip lengths, and trip durations â€“ and coupled them with supply parameters â€“ number of e-bikes, number of swappable batteries, and battery recharging profiles. The primary purpose of these simulations is to evaluate the efficiency of an off-board battery recharging system, where the depleted battery is removed from an e-bike upon its return and inserted into one of the charging slots at the kiosk. We tested various scenarios with different number of batteries always maintaining an initial condition with the battery to e-bike ratio greater or equal to 1.0 to ensure battery availability. We applied empirical battery recharging rates and system operations rules to determine the number of e-bikes and batteries available under different potential demand situations, with a focus on optimizing the number of batteries to meet user demands. By adjusting input parameters, numerous scenarios were simulated for sensitivity analysis. Based on the results of the simulation, this paper presents a cost constrained e-bike sharing system design that can maintain a high level of system reliability (e-bike and battery availability) through optimal battery charging and distribution management. We found that high demand scenarios require multiple swappable batteries per e-bike to reasonably meet the maximum demand. Trip duration has the most influence on e-bike and battery availability, followed by trip rate, and then trip length.",
        "This paper focuses on the identification of the aging mechanism and estimation of the state of health of second-life batteries. Six retired LiFePO4 batteries are selected to conduct cycle life tests under three typical load profiles for energy storage applications. By adopting incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and IC peak area analysis, aging mechanisms in the batteries are studied. All the batteries have shown the same aging pattern with a combination of loss of lithium inventory (LLI) and loss of active materials on negative electrodes (LAMNE). The LLI and LAMNE are analyzed in a quantitative manner to detect the similarities and differences among the batteries operated under different load profiles. To estimate the battery remaining capacity, three types of regression methods are proposed and compared. The features of IC curves are used as inputs to the regression models. The results show that the estimation errors with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and ridge regression methods are within 2%, and that ridge regression has lower root mean square error than OLS regression. Using correlation-based feature selection methods, a universal index that is feasible for all batteries is presented for regression analysis, and the estimation error is found to be within 3%.",
        "Lead is the only toxic metal still in heavy use, and it is used in lead-acid batteries, alloys, and compounds in glass and plastics. This study illustrates the evolution of lead metabolism in China from 1990 to 2015 by applying substance flow analysis (SFA). Lead production and consumption in China increased by 11% and 12% per year in China, respectively. Lead in-use stocks increased from 0.78 to 12.2â€¯Mt, and lead in-use stocks per capita increased from 0.69 to 8.86â€¯kg/capita. Meanwhile, China experienced a rapid growth in lead losses with the explosion of lead metabolism. More than 94% of lead losses were leaded wastes such as dissipated leaded products, waste ores, tailings, and smelting slags. In addition, lead stocks in lead scraps also reached 3.6â€¯Mt. The current lead in-use stocks and lead scraps can provide a huge amount of lead resources for China in the future. However, the rise of new battery technologies and the generalization of lead-free action are denting demand for lead. China should shift lead supplies from primary lead to secondary lead and strictly control lead pollution within the life-cycle of lead resources.",
        "Cell variations always undermine the efficiency of energy utilization of battery pack. How does the temperature non-uniformity affect the status of cell variations remains unclear. This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of the status change of cell variations caused by temperature non-uniformity in a battery pack. First, the status of cell variations has been defined using a graphical model, in which each cell has a coordinate of (capacity, electric quantity). Second, the status transformation caused by temperature non-uniformity has been clarified. Dynamics that describes the thermal-electrochemical effect on the movement of the coordinate for individual cells are firstly established by transformation functions. The movement of the cell locations in the graphical model can vividly interpret the evolution of cell variations caused by temperature non-uniformity with the help of the built transformation functions. Modelling analysis points out that 5â€¯Â°C increase in the maximum temperature difference among the battery pack can lead to 1.5%â€“2% capacity loss of the battery pack, therefore the capacity loss caused by cell variations due to temperature non-uniformity should be considered in battery system design. The methodology can be further used to analyze the status change of cell variations in a battery pack caused by all kinds of temperature non-uniformities, benefiting the design of battery management system with high efficiency of energy utilization.",
        "The wider application of lithium ion batteries brings more production of spent ones to be recovered. There is a pyrometallurgical treatment by getting negative and positive materials burning together. The paper provides theoretical analysis and support for the feasibility of the treatment. Positive material graphite's burning and pyrolysis of negative material lithium cobalt oxide can make up as a coupling reaction, decreasing the decomposition temperature of lithium cobalt oxide from 1426â€¯K to 1173â€¯K. From the point view of crystal structure, the stronger attraction of graphite to oxygen than lithium and cobalt make oxygen octahedrons insides lithium cobalt oxide unstable to break down. We definite the phenomenon as the oxygen octahedrons collapsing model. Coupling reaction theory and crystal structure analysis indicate that graphite does promote the pyrolysis of lithium cobalt oxide. The study can guide industrial application to recover lithium ion batteries whose structure is similar to oxygen octahedrons at a comparatively low temperature.",
        "With the extensive applications of lithium ion batteries, the exploitation and recycle of lithium resources is essential for the manufacture of lithium ion batteries. This work reports that novel lithium ion imprinted polymers (LIPs) loaded on the surface of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were prepared by surface imprinting polymerization. The performance of the prepared LIPs was analyzed by UVâ€“vis recording spectrophotometry, ICP-AES, FT-IR and SEM. The maximum adsorption capacity of the 15â€¯mg LIPs was calculated to be 1362.56 Î¼mol / g at a 300â€¯mg/L Li+ solution. In the presence of Na+, K+, Cu2+ and Zn2+, the selectivity factors of the LIPs for Li+ were 3.66, 3.01, 2.05 and 2.10, respectively, suggesting that the LIPs had ideal selectivity for Li+. In addition, the experimental data can be described well by the pseudo-first-order and Langmuir adsorption isotherm models. The regeneration of the LIPs was performed by being eluted with 1â€¯M nitric acid, and the adsorption capacity of the regenerated LIPs only decreased about 10.3% after ten cycle experiments. Therefore, the strategy described in this work is worth further exploring its application on the extraction and separation of lithium to realize the recovery utilization of lithium in water.",
        "This paper studies a three-period electric vehicle battery recycle and reuse closed-loop supply chain consisting of a battery manufacturer and a remanufacturer. Differing from other products and existing research, used electric vehicle batteries can be instantly reused for other purposes before recycling, such as energy storage. In order to optimise total profits in the whole supply chain in different batteries period of use, this paper develops the optimal pricing strategy between manufacturer and remanufacturer, discusses the relationships between return yield, sorting rate, recycling rate in order to optimise total profit in different period. The result suggests that, comparing with new battery manufacturing, battery recycling and reusing would contribute to reduce raw material consumption hence reduce environmental impact, but may not gain financial benefits. It also notes that although the close-loop supply chain is nonlinearly complicated, some relationships between parameters can be treated as linear or quadratic. The results of this research will help practitioners to better understand the entire closed-loop supply chain in order to enhance its collaboration.",
        "In this study inedited polymetallic nanoparticles were synthesized from electronic wastes of spent lithium-ion batteries (PN-LIB) and applied in the removal of the dye reactive blue 4 (RB4). Initially, the extraction of metals from batteries was performed using HCl/HNO3 (3:1 v/v). Subsequently, the PN-LIB were synthesized via chemical reduction with NaBH4. The PN-LIB showed spherical shape and size smaller than 50â€¯nm, being constituted by Cu, Co, Ni, and Mn. The surface area was estimated at 92.29â€¯m2â€¯gâˆ’1 and the volume and average size of pores in 0.25â€¯cm3â€¯gâˆ’1 and 5.84â€¯nm, respectively. The X-Rays diffractogram presented characteristic peaks of the Cu0. The PN-LIB were applied in the removal of the RB4 dye, in which the effects caused by the variables initial pH, dose of PN-LIB and initial concentration of dye in the removal process were evaluated. There was no significant effect of initial pH on the RB4 removal, since, a natural increase of this parameter occurred in the system and maintained at pH about 8.5. The rate of removal increases with the increase in the dose of PN-LIB and with the reduction of the initial concentration of dye. The experimental data were adjusted to the kinetic model of pseudo-second order and the Langmuir isotherm model, with a maximum capacity of removal, was calculated as being equal to 344.83â€¯mgâ€¯gâˆ’1. The molecular absorption spectra in the UV/Vis region and the infrared spectra indicated that two phenomena happen, adsorption and degradation of the dye.",
        "Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) can well solve the problems faced by alternative single energy storage system in terms of meeting the needs of high specific power and high specific energy simultaneously for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). A HESS containing battery and ultracapacitor (UC) has drawn much attention. However, there have been relatively few reviews on its structures and energy management strategies (EMSs). Based on the summary and analysis from the existing publications, this paper reviews and discusses the structures and the EMSs of HESSs comprised of battery and UC. Focusing on energy management research, a detailed discussion of rules-based control algorithms, optimization-based control algorithms and intelligent-based control algorithms is presented. Several typical implementations and applications are presented in detail, and a comparative evaluation of these methods can help researchers select the appropriate method to develop EMSs for HESSs. Finally, the paper also highlights a number of key factors and challenges, and presents the possible recommendations for the development of big data and machine learning-based algorithm for the energy management of the HESSs.",
        "The development of electric vehicles (EVs) is beneficial to a cleaner environment. As the powertrain of EVs, power battery is limited obviously by its fast operating temperature rise and large temperature variation among different parts, so an efficient battery thermal management (BTM) system is desirable. In this paper, a battery thermal management system using kaolin/expanded graphite (EG)/paraffin composite was designed. By contrasting different thermal properties of ternary composites with various proportions, the most suitable composite with 10â€¯wt% EG and 10â€¯wt% kaolin was selected for the thermal management testing, which has a conductivity of larger than 6â€¯W/(mÂ·K) and did not shows any visible leakage after 30â€¯minâ€¯at 60â€¯Â°C. In the thermal management test, the temperature of a single battery was effectively controlled under 45â€¯Â°C even at the discharge rate of 4C, and the temperature difference of the single battery was restrained within 5â€¯Â°C. Besides, the composite had reduced the temperature of the battery pack by 25.77% at 4C rate, and the temperature difference of the battery pack or each battery in the pack could be greatly controlled once the phase change occurred. In conclusion, the excellent temperature controlling performance of the new phase change material (PCM) was verified in this paper, and the importance of reasonable dosage distribution of PCM in battery pack was put forward.",
        "Insights from battery research and development (R&D) need to be transferred into industrial application to create innovations and thus foster e.g. electro mobility. In terms of battery technology transfer, the early phase of application is particularly challenging due to the close intertwining between R&D and application. Therefore, the present study introduces start-ups as an additional indicator to capture the transition from science to industry within the technology life cycle. The findings show that despite highly dynamic R&D activities, technology transfer is only taking place on a very limited level. Surprisingly, start-ups focus on incremental improvements of existing technologies instead of introducing radical breakthrough-technologies. An analysis of the battery value chain reveals that opportunities for start-ups are rather located downstream in the value chain when integrating cells to battery systems and developing applications relying on innovative battery technologies. The findings contribute to the area of technology life cycle analysis explicitly using start-up companies as additional indicator for the critical transfer step from R&D to application. In a similar vein, technology forecasting literature, which is to date mainly focused on R&D, is expanded by a more application-centred perspective that allows identifying transfer opportunities along the technology value chain.",
        "The social capital selection is one of the most important issues in public-private partnership project of electrochemical storage power station. However, two problems reducing the decision-making rationality and accuracy exist in the present multi-criteria decision analysis. First, the existing evaluation index system does not can reflect the technological characteristics of electrochemical storage power station; second, some information distortion and loss are caused by the uncertainty in the evaluation values and the criteria weights. In order to overcome these deficiencies, the innovations of this paper are as follows: â‘ this paper built a social capital selection evaluation index system specifically targeted at electrochemical storage power station, the results of social capital selection are more in line with the actual needs of power station construction and operation; â‘¡ trapezoidal interval type-2 hesitant fuzzy number as the mathematics symbol of linguistic terms are used to established a evaluation model, which can balance the convenience of opinion expression and the accuracy of evaluation value; â‘¢ the maximizing deviations principle was used to handle the interval weights under the linguistic environment, it not only allowed the experts to express subjective weights as possible as they can, but also realized objective weightsâ€™ information mining by using the deviations of evaluation data. The aforementioned innovations together constitute a social capital selection framework of electrochemical storage power station. Finally, the effectiveness of decision framework was verified based on a case study of China.",
        "Solar and wind energy are the two most available renewable energy resources in the world. In this paper, a high-resolution analysis that allows sizing a hybrid photovoltaic-wind turbine-battery banks has been carried out. The analysis aims to minimize the annualized cost of the systems satisfying two reliability constraints. The solution has been obtained numerically by means of an iterative technique. The decision variables are the photovoltaic area, wind turbine radius, and battery capacity. A high-resolution model, based on fuzzy logic inference system, has been developed to evaluate the number of active occupants and the domestic electricity consumption. In order to allow a more accurate sizing of the system, a new reliability parameter named seasonal loss of load probability ratio that takes into account the seasonality of data has been defined. Seasonal loss of load probability ratio has been used in the iterative process in addition to the most common loss of load probability. Compared with traditional processes, the obtained results demonstrate that the introduction of the new parameter to iterative process causes a meaningful improvement of the system's reliability and a slight increase of its cost on the other hand. The simulation, conducted in MATLABÂ® environment, has been carried out to supply power for a domestic dwelling located in three different locations of Sicily. Compared to reliability values arising from the traditional procedure, the obtained results show that a reliability improvement of 75% is reached by using the new sizing procedure. Therefore, the proposed methodology gives an important advancement on the current state of the art since it allows at designing renewable plants in a more efficient way.",
        "In this study, pyrolysis was utilized to enhance the liberation of electrode particles in the recycling process of spent lithium-ion batteries. Pyrolysis characteristics of cathode and anode materials and the effects of pyrolysis on the liberation of electrode materials were fully investigated. Afterwards, scanning electron microscope coupled with an energy dispersive spectrometer and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to reveal the changes of mineralogical characteristics of electrode materials before and after pyrolysis. The results indicate that organic binder wrapped on electrode particles is the main reason that electrode materials are hard to liberate from foils and difficult to liberate each other. The optimum pyrolysis temperature of organic binders in electrode materials is 500â€¯Â°C and the main pyrolysis products are fluorine-containing benzene and ester electrolyte. The liberation efficiency of cathode increases from 82.88% to 99.78% by pyrolysis, while that of anode increases from 88.08% to 99.60%. Meanwhile, adequate liberation of pyrolytic electrode materials requires a shorter period of time. Electrode materials from pyrolytic electrode are mainly concentrated inÂ âˆ’0.045â€¯mm size fraction, and they are up to 82.49% and 78.91% respectively for cathode and anode materials. 5106.",
        "Lithium-ion battery is a critical part in various industrial applications. In practice, the performance of such batteries degrades over time. To maintain the battery performance and ensure their reliability, it is important to implement on-line life cycle health state assessment in a battery management system. However, two big challenges in on-line battery actual capacity estimation must be overcome. The first one is the on-line extraction of measurable degradation features. The other one is the on-line mapping from the degradation feature space to the battery capacity space. This paper proposes a self-adaptive life-cycle health state assessment method based on the on-line measurable parameters of lithium-ion battery. Ten different degradation features are extracted from the voltage, electric current and critical time during operation. These degradation features are fused to achieve a higher adaptability to complex operating conditions. The lithium-ion battery health state is assessed with a mapping model that links the feature space to the capacity space. The model is trained by the least squares support vector machine method for less computational complexity. The experimental results based on the real battery testing data show that the correlation between the degradation feature and the battery capacity is higher than 0.7 and the mean error of capacity estimation is less than 0.05. For the dynamic operation conditions, the mean error of capacity estimation is less than 11â€¯mAh. This study illustrates the adaptability and applicability of the proposed on-line life-cycle health state assessment approach in various electric vehicle applications.",
        "Electricity stands as the main energy used for lead-acid battery (LAB) manufacturing. This study introduces an energy management methodology to address the electricity consumption in lead-acid battery plants, improving efficiency standards. The â€œequivalent battery productionâ€ is introduced to define the energy performance criteria to be met in the different production sections of the battery plant. The methodology combines the guidelines of the ISO 50001 standard with the energy management framework for manufacturing plants. The result is a structured approach for detecting inefficiencies and pinpointing their sources. The management methodology was implemented during 2016. In the formation area 222â€¯MWh were saved during 2016. This saving accounts for 3.9% less electricity than forecasted by the energy baseline of the area. Additionally, the emission of some 40 tCO2.eq. associated with the generation of the electricity production were saved. Moreover, at plant level 424â€¯MWh were saved, which account for 3.6% less electricity than forecasted by the energy baseline of the plant. In total, around 76 tCO2.eq. were saved as a result of the electricity savings in the plant.",
        "The aerial lithium-ion battery pack works differently from the usual battery packs, the working characteristic of which is intermittent supplement charge and instantaneous large current discharge. An adaptive state of charge estimation method combined with the output voltage tracking strategy is proposed by using the reduced particle - unscented Kalman filter, which is based on the reaction mechanism and experimental characteristic analysis. The improved splice equivalent circuit model is constructed together with its state-space description, in which the operating characteristics can be obtained. The relationship function between the open circuit voltage and the state of charge is analyzed and especially optimized. The feasibility and accuracy characteristics are tested by using the aerial lithium-ion battery pack experimental samples with seven series-connected battery cells. Experimental results show that the state of charge estimation error is less than 2.00%. The proposed method achieves the state of charge estimation accurately for the aerial lithium-ion battery pack, which provides a core avenue for its high-power supply security.",
        "Sisal is a perennial tropical biomass with largest dosage in industry. Due to the special hard structure of sisal fiber, it can be prepared as carbon material and applied for negative material of lead-carbon battery. The pretreatment of sisal fiber was carried out by 5% NaOH and 5% H3PO4 and tested by the measurement of FTIR, thermogravimetric analysis and SEM. Carbazole was doped in pretreated sisal fiber to prepare carbon material by a simple approach with two-step method. The characterization of the synthesis doped-N carbon material was tested by Raman, BET, XRD and EDS. According to the result of BET, it was turned out that the doped-N carbon material had a larger specific surface area. And the electrochemical properties were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Besides, the cycling life test and charge/discharge curve were performed on battery testing instrument. In addition, the lead-carbon battery contained doped-N carbon material had a longer discharge plateau and a higher ultimate capacity. It was concluded that doped-N carbon material had a better electrochemical performance compared to undoped-N carbon material.",
        "Spent lithium-ion batteries have caused global concern owing to their rich resource metal content and high potential for polluting the environment. In the present study, a green, efficient, and simple process was developed to recycle and detoxify Li, Mn, Cu, Al, Co, and Ni from spent lithium-ion mobile phone batteries using adapted Aspergillus niger. The adaptation of Aspergillus niger to heavy metals improved the production of organic acids and the leaching efficiency of metals compared to unadapted fungi. Moreover, it decreased the time required to enter the logarithmic phase and increased the speed of acid production. In the presence of spent lithium-ion battery powder, gluconic acid was the main lixiviant produced by the adapted fungi. At a pulp density of 1% (w/v), the adapted Aspergillus niger leached 100% Li, 94% Cu, 72% Mn, 62% Al, 45% Ni, and 38% Co. The results of SEM, FTIR, XRD, EDX, and mapping analyses of the original spent battery powder and bioleached residue confirmed the effectiveness of fungal metabolites to leach the metals of spent lithium-ion mobile phone batteries.",
        "Advanced lithium-ion battery systems, in multi-cell configurations and larger-scale operations, are being currently developed for energy storage applications. Furthermore, the retired batteries are being increasingly second utilized in energy storage scenes. Thus, realistic and accurate battery state of health diagnosis and related aging mechanisms identification is desired to improve the battery management and control, and eventually guarantee the reliability and safety of the battery system. A half-cell model based battery state of health diagnostic method is proposed to investigate the aging mechanisms and possible attribute to the capacity fade in a quantitative manner. Using particle swarm optimization algorithm, the half-cell model is parameterized to quantify the battery degradation mechanisms derived from the parameter variations, which describe the electrode behavior with proper matching ratio and their evolutions at different battery aging levels. The reliability and robustness of the approach has been verified and evaluated by the database of the cells experienced different aging paths. Our approach is a data-model fusion method to offer the benefits of wide applicability to various cell chemistries and operating modes.",
        "The market of electric taxi has achieved rapid development in China recently, while further development is hindered by technical factors such as battery mileage and charging. First-tier cities as Beijing have explored and innovated in electric taxi business models to make up for the deficiencies caused by technological immaturity at the present stage. From the perspective of value chain, this paper carries out an analysis on current status of electric taxi business models in Beijing, and proposes a model for analyzing its economy. Moreover, a comparative analysis was conducted on the economy and sensitivity of battery changing and battery charging models based on field research data acquired from Pinggu District of Beijing. The research findings are as follows: a) overall, the battery changing model is better than the battery charging model economically. b) the sensitivity of the battery changing model to project period, carbon price and charging price is significantly higher than that of the charging model, because of its higher service frequency and greater service quantity. c) among all the influencing factors, charging price has the greatest influence on the two models. d) in the battery changing model, the breakeven point of the whole business model gradually declines as electricity price rises, so the battery changing model still can survive even without government subsidies. e) owing to vehicle loss, battery loss and other reasons, the two models have an optimal period respectively, but the greater loss of the battery changing model results in that its optimal project period is shorter than that of the battery charging model.",
        "With increasing worldwide attention on clean energy and sustainability of environment development, electric vehicle (EV) projects have been growing in number and scale all over the world. However, increasing demand-supply imbalance in charging infrastructure becomes the major obstacle of Chinese EV development. Governments are applying Public-Private Partnership (PPP) mode in this field to effectively make use of solid capital and advanced technological capability of private sector to improve charging performance and service. To ensure project success, risk evaluation, which has remained nebulous, has become a crucial step. This paper aims to explore risk factors through questionnaire survey and calculate the overall risk levels of EV charging infrastructure PPP projects with an integrated approach with Fuzzy Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Fuzzy TOPSIS). Results of risk factors identification consisted of project/technical, political/legal, economic and social/environmental risk categories and four risk factors were selected for specific concern of charging infrastructure in China: inadequate PPP project experience, high battery cost, long charging period and power price rise. Overall risk levels of three alternative projects were evaluated and ranked with proposed approach whose feasibility and effectiveness were verified through a comparative analysis and a sensitivity analysis. Moreover, awareness of existing risks, suggestions were provided for private sectors of EV charging infrastructure PPP project. The detailed implications and limitations were presented in the suggestions and the conclusions.",
        "Over the last decades, electricity demand and supply have become more decentralized, and the opportunities for locally managed microgrids have increased. Especially for residential microgrids consisting of multiple residential buildings equipped with a substantial share of local thermal and electrical energy production, flexibility is needed to balance energy demand and energy supply over time. Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) and thermal energy storage systems can provide this flexibility. Even though some BESS solutions are already available on the market, BESS still suffer from technical limitations and entail high investment costs. As BESS deteriorate over time depending on usage characteristics and the surrounding conditions, actively managing these parameters will largely affect their potential lifetime and the economic viability of their application. The majority of current research has focused on using BESS to optimize energy systems for economical, ecological, and technical objectives, but barely considered battery aging in the optimization models themselves. To contribute to closing this research gap, this article proposes an optimization model for the optimal day-ahead management of a multi-building district considering battery aging costs (BAC) derived from specific literature on battery degradation mechanisms. The resulting non-linear model is linearized and solved by using a commercial solver. Computational studies are performed to illustrate the case of a hybrid integrated local energy supplier responsible for the multi-building district, and sensitivities of its operating profits towards different sizing and pricing parameters are investigated. Results confirm the importance of considering BAC in decision support models for managing energy systems, both for a cost-efficient management of battery operations and to improve battery lifetime. The results also indicate that the application of BESS in day-ahead markets are only relevant for future cost levels of the technology.",
        "The impact of SOC and temperature on external short circuit (ESC) faults characteristics of lithium-ion batteries, including the current and voltage variation and temperature increase, are analyzed. A fractional-order model (FOM) and a first-order RC model are both employed to describe the electrical behavior of the battery cells with the ESC fault. While the model parameters are identified by the genetic algorithm (GA). A comparison study is made on the prediction accuracy for the two models. An effective classification method based on a random forests (RF) model is proposed to recognize the electrolyte leakage behavior that occurs during the ESC fault experiments. Based on the above efforts, the three steps model-based diagnosis algorithm for identifying the ESC fault and even electrolyte leakage of the battery in real-time is proposed. Two indicators of the root mean square error (RMSE) of battery predicting voltage are applied to diagnose for the ESC fault only and ESC-leakage merged fault. The result of the leakage condition is obtained by a pre-trained RF classifier to confirm the leakage detection result based on the RMSE indicator. Several cases are verified that all the ESC cells can be diagnosed efficiently.",
        "With consumersâ€™ increasing awareness of environmental problems, green marketing is becoming an important approach for firms to gain a competitive advantage. However, green marketing decoupled from substantive action tends to be perceived as greenwashing by consumers. Compared to a large body of green marketing research, little work has focused on consumersâ€™ greenwashing perceptions and its associated consequences. Thus, based on the attitude-behaviour-context theory, this study explored whether and how consumersâ€™ greenwashing perceptions influence their green purchasing intentions by integrating the mediating role of green word-of-mouth (WOM) and the moderating role of green concern. Using a questionnaire survey of 553 consumers of batteries in China, the results demonstrate that consumersâ€™ greenwashing perceptions not only have a direct negative impact on green purchasing intentions, but also have indirect negative effects via green WOM. Further, green concern strengthens the negative relationship between greenwashing perceptions and green purchasing intentions. Hence, this study suggests that firms should promote substantive environmental initiatives rather than greenwashing to ensure consumers and increase sales.",
        "The on-board battery is the primary energy storage device of the electric vehicle that provides power to drive all actuators of the chassis, i.e., the energy consumption of each actuator has a direct impact on the vehicleâ€™s energy management system. To reduce energy consumption while steering and improve the handling stability of electric vehicles, a novel electricâ€“hydraulic hybrid steering (Eâ€“HHPS) system with multiple steering modes is presented herein. The electric power mode is used to reduce the overall energy consumption of the system by adaptive intervention, whereas the hybrid power mode is responsible for the steering portability in conditions of increased steering torque. To further improve the performance of the Eâ€“HHPS system, the structural parameter optimization model of the E-HHPS system is established based on the consideration of the steering economy, steering road feeling, and steering sensitivity. To solve the multi-objective optimization problem with characteristics of increased dimensions, a shuffled particle swarm optimization algorithm (SPSO) is proposed to realize a combination of a local search and global information exchange. The simulation results demonstrate that compared with the EHPS system, the Eâ€“HHPS system has a better steering economy at low vehicular speeds. In addition, the Eâ€“HHPS system optimized by the SPSO algorithm can considerably reduce the steering energy consumption and noticeably improve the handling performance of the vehicle.",
        "Plug-in electrical vehicles (PEVs) are introduced as a compatible transportation system for the environment. Manufacturing technology of electric vehicles (EVs) could bring an opportunity to implement them as energy storages. By expanding the use of renewable energy sources (RESs), the role of energy storage system is highlighted to overcome power generation fluctuations. Integrating PEVs and RESs could be profitable for both PEV and RESs owners. In this paper, a structure of renewable energy sources based micro grid (RMG) is considered. The proposed RMG has been equipped with a parking lot in order to control and aggregate PEVs. This paper investigates the optimal energy management problem of the RMG with the presence of PEVs. The objective of the RMG owner is to minimize the cost through generating power with its local generators and trading energy with the power market considering the market price. Also, the RMG could incentive PEV owners to take part in the demand response (DR) programs as a flexible load. It could bring profit for both PEVs and RMG owners. The existence uncertainties are modeled in the scenario-based framework. Three case studies are analyzed to display the effectiveness of the proposed model. As a result, utilization of the parking lot has decreased the cost of RMG about 40%. Additionally, implementing DR program during the charging process of PEVs could bring extra profit for both RMG and PEVs owners. The results have shown the efficiency of the proposed method.",
        "In recent years, electric vehicles have developed rapidly in China, and recycling a large number of their spent power batteries will become a substantial challenge in the near future. However, the specific mechanisms and policies for recycling spent power batteries have still not been established in China. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to propose reward-penalty mechanisms and policies, and test their impacts on power battery recycling by using a Staklberg game theory based model. In the model, three single recycling channel modes and three competitive dual recycling channel modes were considered respectively. Furthermore, the total social welfare is used as the indicator to select the optimal recycling modes, which includes participants' profit, consumer surplus, government's supervision cost, energy-saving and carbon emission reduction effect. The obtained analysis results show that: (i) the intensive reward-penalty mechanism is more suitable for higher recycling rate modes, otherwise it may cause benefit losses, and thus, setting a reasonable minimum recycling rate as benchmark for reward-penalty mechanism is critically important; (ii) Environmental awareness has significant impacts on social benefits of power battery recycling; (iii) M&R (mode with competition between manufacturer and retailer in the recycling channels) has obvious advantages among these six recycling modes.",
        "Battery energy storage systems (ESS) are the proper technologies to reduce operational cost of electrical networks as well as smoothing wind uncertainty. However, some characteristics of the battery energy storage systems have not been accurately analyzed such as coordination of initial energy and depth of discharge (DOD) and determining their optimal levels. Moreover, the impacts of these parameters on the planning and operational costs have not been appropriately addressed. In order to address such shortcomings, current paper presents a unified stochastic planning on battery energy storage systems in electric power systems including wind power plants. The proposed planning considers following items as objective function and optimizes them: cost of energy in the network (i.e., generators fuel cost) and investment-operational costs and lifetime of battery energy storage systems. The design variable are also classified in three categories as (i) optimal generation scheduling (i.e., determining optimal generation pattern for all generators at each hour over the day), (ii) optimal energy storage planning (i.e., denoting capacity of batteries, nominal power of interfacing converters, and location of battery energy storage units), and (iii) optimal energy storage scheduling (i.e., determining optimal charging-discharging pattern, initial energy, depth-of-discharge, lifetime, and life-cycle for energy storage units). All of these items are carried out through stochastic modeling under wind power uncertainties. The paper presents a proper coordination between design variables such as initial energy and depth-of-discharge in order to minimize the network operational cost, maximizing lifetime of battery energy storage system, and smoothing wind uncertainty. The efficiency of the introduced methodology is demonstrated through various analyses and comparative studies.",
        "In this paper, a mechanical separation and thermal treatment process is developed to recover valuable metals and graphite from theÂ âˆ’0.25â€¯mm crushed products of spent lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). Effect of key parameters for roasting such as the temperature and roasting time are investigated to determine the most efficient conditions for surface modification of the mixed electrode materials by roasting. The roasted mixed electrode materials are separated by flotation operation to recover the cathode material and anode materials respectively. The results show that most of the organic outer layer coated on the surface of the mixed electrode materials can be removed at the temperature of 450â€¯Â°C for 15â€¯min. After roasting treatment, the original wettability of LiCoO2 and graphite is regained. TheÂ âˆ’0.25â€¯mm crushed products of spent LiBs can be separated into LiCoO2 concentrate and graphite concentrate by flotation process efficiently. The enrichment ratios of Co, Mn, Cu and Al are 1.35, 1.29, 1.25 and 1.19, their recovery rates are 97.66%, 93.66%, 90.14% and 86.29%, respectively. This process proposed for the recovery of valuable materials is simple and of high efficient for the spent lithium-ion batteries recycling industry.",
        "Lithium-ion battery packs have become increasingly important for power supply applications, in which the state of charge estimation and output voltage tracking should be very critical for the safety protection. A novel real-time estimation method is proposed by using the improved extended Kalman filtering algorithm together with the two-order resistance and capacitance circuit network battery model, aiming to solve its security protection issues. Experimental results show that this method can track the voltage signals effectively along with the real-time state estimation in the discharging and charging maintenance operation processes. The battery cell voltage detection accuracy is found to be 1.00â€¯mV and the pack voltage measurement error is less than 20.00â€¯mV. Meanwhile, the state of charge value can be estimated with a great accuracy of 2.00%, in which the state of balance parameter is considered for the internal connected battery cells. The developed experimental associated battery management system can be used for the working state monitoring in the aerial power supply application of the lithium-ion battery pack.",
        "Electric vehicles, photovoltaic systems and battery storages are promising components of sustainable mobility and energy solutions for private households. A fast marked diffusion of these technologies requires their cost competitiveness against conventional technologies such as internal combustion engine vehicles and fossil-fired power plants. System Dynamics is hypothesized to advance the development of sophisticated business models for sustainable solutions as it makes mental models of a business explicit and thus better assessable on the basis of simulation studies. While pursuing the main aim of ensuring the cost advantage of sustainable solutions over conventional ones, three crucial issues are addressed: First, the economic benefit depends on the customer specific driving profiles and load profiles of the households, so a differentiated consideration of the mass market is needed to identify suitable target customers for sustainable solutions. Second, the cost advantage is affected by the volatility of environmental factors such as electricity prices, feed-in remunerations and fuel prices. Therefore, a regular view of the cost competitiveness of sustainable solutions has to be conducted in order to run a viable business. Third, the technological synergies between electric vehicles, photovoltaic systems and battery storages allow customers to be more independent from electricity prices. Hence, a prudent technical design of sustainable solutions is essential if the economic benefits for the customers are to be fully leveraged. Based on System Dynamics, a newly developed techno-economic model of mobility and energy solutions depicts the technological synergies between the three components and the resulting costs for mobility and energy. Through parameter variations, the model user is able to modify the customer needs, the environmental factors and the technical design options in order to gain an immediate feedback concerning the change in costs. Exemplary simulation runs including ideal-typical customer profiles and solution designs within the German market demonstrate that the realizable share of photovoltaic energy among the driving current holds strong economic benefits besides the ecological ones. The model is validated with a German utility company and serves as a scientific basis for their business development and their future marketing programs.",
        "Lithium is central at least in the short term, for transitions to renewable energy. Substantial deposits reside in South America's 'lithium triangle' in Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. Bolivia has promoted lithium industrialization through vertically integrated mineral development under resource nationalism and public-private partnerships with foreign corporations. Central to the Bolivian vision is a desire to harness the most environmentally appropriate technologies for national development and to move away from exploitative extractive models so prevalent in developing countries. Bolivia has been at the forefront of Global South climate change arguments about carbon debt and resource rights for just and fair sustainable development. We discuss the debate on cleaner production for lithium, challenges of Bolivia's lithium industrialization under Indigenous President Morales, and investigate how the desire for cleaner technologies has cultivated unusual governance arrangements via public private partnerships (PPPs) between state enterprises and foreign-owned private corporations. We consider this model for developing remote mineral reserves for advanced cleaner production technologies that are necessary for the transition from a fossil fuel to a low carbon global economy, alongside addressing sustainable development goals. Lithium is vital for energy storage, renewable energy and the electric vehicle industry. To meet rising lithium demand with minimal environmental and social impacts, novel approaches are needed to international resource extraction partnerships that transcend ideological biases; with their efficacy evaluated. Our research aims to pave the way to such an evaluative framework, using Bolivia's lithium as a central case.

        "The installation of PV systems in residential buildings has seen a dramatic increase in the last decade thanks to national policies like Feed in Tariff and Net Metering. Several users are now needing to increase their share of self-consumption to optimize the profits from their systems. Energy storage systems are entering the market in last years, claiming to provide an interesting upgrade for existing PV systems. In a broader perspective, energy storage systems will have a significant impact on the entire energy production and conversion processes. The aim of this paper is to present an analysis of the energetic and economic performance of an electricity storage system, compared with the net metering scheme, which is an effective economic support for residential PV systems in different countries. This research work is based on the Italian market as a case study, to perform a detailed analysis on the net metering scheme. Multiple parameters are considered into the calculation, including the location, the PV size, the storage size and a range of installation costs. The results highlight the main issues related to this technology, both from an energetic and economic point of view. While the economic sustainability is currently far from being reached, also the electricity losses generated in the storage system appear to be a significant disadvantage.",
        "One possibility for electrification of road transport consists of battery electric vehicles in combination with carbon-free sources of electricity. It is highly likely that lithium-ion batteries will provide the basis for this development. In the present paper, we use a recently developed, semi-quantitative assessment scheme to evaluate the relative supply risks associated with the elements used in the functional materials of six different lithium-ion battery types. Eleven different indicators in four supply risk categories are applied to each element; the weighting of the indicators is determined by external experts within the framework of an Analytic Hierarchy Process. The range of supply risk values on the elemental level is distinctly narrower than in our previous work on photovoltaic materials. The highest values are obtained for lithium and cobalt; the lowest for aluminium and titanium. Copper, iron, nickel, carbon (graphite), manganese and phosphorous form the middle group. We then carry out the assessment of the six battery types, to give comparative supply risks at the technology level. For this purpose the elemental supply risk values are aggregated using four different methods. Due to the small spread at the elemental level the supply risk values in all four aggregation methods also lie in a narrow range. Removing lithium, aluminium and phosphorous from the analysis, which are present in all types of battery, improves the situation. For aggregation with the simple arithmetic mean, an uncertainty analysis shows that only lithium-iron phosphate has a measurably lower supply risk compared to the other battery types. For the â€œcost-shareâ€ aggregation using seven elements, lithium cobalt oxide has a substantially higher supply risk than most other types.",
        "Residential photovoltaic systems with battery energy storage could help accelerate the transition to a more efficient, secure and reliable electricity supply. Understanding and managing the risks associated with this complex, consumer-led transformation will be critical to minimize disruption and achieve effective integration. In this paper, we use a case study of Queensland Australia and causal loop modelling, underpinned by qualitative data sourced from extensive interviews with expert stakeholders, to consider how residential battery energy storage deployed at-scale could erode the dominance of the traditional centralized electricity supply model. With feedback loops highlighting the primacy of the consumer in coming years, our modelling suggests that a failure by incumbent utilities and policy makers to respond to consumer needs, or subvert access to battery technology, will ultimately reinforce consumer drivers for self-sufficiency and grid independence. Our analysis highlights that energy policy should address consumersâ€™ non-financial motivations for grid independence while concurrently incentivizing the strategic management of home battery energy storage to achieve beneficial whole-of-system outcomes. The development of price-based signals that assign fair-value along the supply chain could help achieve both of these objectives. Our analysis highlights the importance of taking a long-term, systems-based view of residential battery deployment to avoid negative outcomes along the supply chain and to help achieve the most efficient integration.

        "As an energy storage device, battery has been rapid developed in recent years with the typical environmental problems such as consumption of resources and heavy metal pollution. Therefore, it is urgent to conduct a comprehensive analysis and in-depth interpretation of the environmental impact of the battery industry to reduce environmental pollution. Life cycle assessment is applied to analyze and compare the environmental impact of lead acid battery (LAB), lithium manganese battery (LMB) and lithium iron phosphate battery (LIPB) within the system boundary of â€œcradle-to-gateâ€. The key processes and the key substances of environmental impact are identified by the traceability. The results showed that the overall impact of LIPB production on environment is the smallest. The key substances that cause the environmental impact of LAB production process are refined lead and tin. Lithium manganate and aluminum shell are the key substances that cause the environmental impact of lithium manganese oxide production process. The key substances that cause the environmental impact of lithium iron phosphate production process are lithium iron phosphate and aluminum shell. According to the position of each key substance in the process, the Reduce-Reuse-Recycle principle of circular economy theory is adopted to suggest the corresponding optimization. This research can provide useful reference for government decision-making and the sustainable development of battery industry.",
        "Numerous studies exist on the environmental impact of Li-Ion battery (LIB) production. Nevertheless, these studies use different impact assessment methods and different approaches for modelling key aspects like energy demand for cell manufacturing or the composition of the cell package. Since the outcomes of the studies are highly sensitive on these aspects, a direct comparison of the corresponding results is not possible. However, a robust comparative analysis would be of high interest for evaluating the actual environmental performance of different alternative battery chemistries. Based on a review of existing LCA studies on LIB production, the corresponding discrepancies in the modelling of these key aspects are pointed out and their impact on the outcomes of the underlying studies is highlighted. The existing primary life cycle inventory data (LCI) for the principle LIB chemistries are then recompiled and common average values implemented for the identified key parameters. In this way, the environmental impacts associated with the production of different battery chemistries are assessed on a common base. This provides an improved comparability between studies and allows for a tentative technology benchmarking of different Li-Ion battery chemistries. It can be observed that the different assumptions and modelling approaches for the mentioned key aspects can have a stronger impact on the final results than the battery chemistry itself. Especially the approach for modelling the cell manufacturing energy demand, but also for the electrode binder and the battery management system influence the results significantly. Thus, putting existing LCA studies on a common base is essential for battery technology benchmarking and avoids erroneous conclusions when comparing the environmental impacts associated with the production of different Li-Ion battery chemistries."

        "Rising CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and human activities pose a serious challenge to energy sustainability and environmental health, and the reduction of CO2 into high added-value carbon fuels and chemicals through photocatalytic reduction is considered to be an effective strategy to simultaneously address global environmental issues and the energy crisis. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction into renewable energy sources, particularly through the use of semiconductor photocatalysts like titanium dioxide (TiO2), presents a promising avenue to alleviate greenhouse gas impacts while addressing the energy crisis. However, the efficiency and selectivity of CO2 photoreduction are hampered by the inherent limitations of photocatalysts, including poor light utilization and ineffective charge carrier dynamics. This review article focuses on the transformative role of oxygen vacancies (OVs) in enhancing the photocatalytic performance for CO2 reduction. It highlights the pivotal advances in oxygen vacancy engineering within semiconductor photocatalysts, notably TiO2 and Bi-based materials, for improved solar-driven CO2 reduction. By facilitating CO2 adsorption and activation, extending light absorption, and promoting charge carrier separation, OVs emerge as critical modifiers to augment photocatalytic efficiency and selectivity towards valuable carbon-based fuels. This comprehensive review not only scrutinizes the mechanisms by which OVs enhance photocatalytic activity but also delves into the challenges of OV concentration control, photocatalyst stability, and synthesis scalability. Moreover, it emphasizes the urgent need for advancing semiconductor photocatalyst selectivity to elevate the utility of CO2 photoreduction technology. The practical applications for environmental remediation underline the real-world significance of advancing OV-engineered photocatalysts. By integrating recent findings with methodological insights, the article offers new directions for future research aimed at the development of efficient and selective photocatalysts for sustainable CO2 reduction.",

        "With the growing global focus on energy efficiency and environmental impact, the semiconductor industry faces the dual challenge of improving production efficiency and reducing energy consumption. Heat loss is an important source of energy consumption in semiconductor production, so optimizing heat loss is of great significance. This paper aims to explore the optimization method of semiconductor production scheduling based on deep learning technology, with special attention to the reduction of heat loss, so as to achieve the coordinated development of industrial economy. The source of thermal energy loss in semiconductor production is analyzed and a deep learning model is constructed to predict thermal energy loss under different production scheduling schemes. Through deep learning training of production data, the model can identify and optimize the thermal energy consumption patterns of each link in the production process. In order to achieve the balance between minimum heat loss and maximum production efficiency, a variety of production scheduling schemes are optimized using simulated annealing algorithms. The experimental results show that the production scheduling scheme based on deep learning can effectively reduce heat loss and optimize production efficiency. Compared with traditional scheduling methods, the optimized system has reduced thermal energy loss and increased production efficiency.

        "The energy gap between primary sources of energy like coal, oil, and natural gas will be 14 TW by 2050, hence finding sustainable sources of energy is the need of the day to bridge this gap. Hydrogen (H2) in water is freely and abundantly available in nature, thus, the effective combination of light energy and water to produce hydrogen in an environmentally acceptable manner has a great potential to meet the current as well as future world's energy demand. Several semiconductors (SC's) have been employed to catalyze the formation of hydrogen from water (H2O). But the practical and feasible applicability of this system is limited due to photocatalyst high energy demand via wide band gap, quick recombination of photoexcited charge carriers (electron/hole pairs), easy nanoparticles agglomeration in solution and low photocatalyst surface area for adsorption. The incorporation of the majestic graphene material with the SC alone or in multiple SC's system can improve photocatalytic H2-production. Therefore, this review systematically presents an overview of, to shape graphene into a photocatalyst, graphene role in water splitting and in the interfacial charge-migration dynamics at surface contacts. We also focused on the built-in mechanism of the heterostructures comprises of photocatalyst (mainly TiO2, ZnO and WO3) and graphene-based nanomaterials (pure graphene (G), graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (r-GO)) and their combination thereof for H2 generation in aqueous system. Composite comprised of SC's/graphene could potentially be a promising green light in the future of solar energy-led photocatalysis, specifically aimed at energy production.",
        "Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting integrating light absorption and electrocatalysis in a single system is a promising technology to harness and store solar energy in the form of chemical energy. The stored solar energy in the form of hydrogen chemical bonds is called solar fuels. The burning of hydrogen fuel in a fuel-cell or suitable combustion engines produces water and heat as by-products so it is considered environmentally safe and can produce sustainable carbon free energy. PEC water splitting using single semiconductor photoabsorber is potentially not a viable option to achieve practical solar to hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 10% due to requirement of additional external bias in addition to finding cost-effective earth abundant materials to have straddle band edge positions with respect to water redox potential and being chemically inert in aqueous environment for long time. Combining two suitable complementary semiconductors as photoanode and photocathode in tandem architecture provides maximized optical absorption, sufficient photovoltage, and better theoretical STH efficiency of above 22%. In principle, the tandem system delivers enough photopotential to self-drive water splitting reaction without assistance of external bias. Though, variety of semiconductor materials available to use them in tandem architecture, metal-oxide semiconductors are considered as better alternative than III-V and silicon semiconductors because of their chemically stability, availability, cost-effective, facile and scalable synthesis procedure, and ability to tune the bandgap by compositional changing in binary, ternary, and quaternary compounds. In this book chapter, we discuss the role of metal oxide semiconductors for unassisted solar water splitting and compare the recent literature results and provide possible solutions to improve the PEC performance of metal-oxides based unassisted solar water splitting.",
        "The semiconductor and display industries are key to the transition to a digital economy and are leading export industries that drive the economy of Korea. Concurrently, these industries are substantial contributors to the nation's greenhouse gas emissions. Emission reduction policies to maintain the sustainability of these industries and realize global carbon neutrality are urgently needed, and accurate emission forecasts are a prerequisite for this. Although greenhouse gas emission forecasts have been made for various industries, no such forecasts have been made for the semiconductor and display industries. This study aims to forecast emissions in Korea's semiconductor and display sector using an improved grey model that accounts for the reliability and predictability of limited data. The analysis showed that the IGM (1,3) provided the highest accuracy and reliability, and projected continuous increases in greenhouse gas emissions from the semiconductor and electronic components industries. Based on the results, this study recommends that: (1) greenhouse gas reduction technologies be developed and institutional adjustments made in the semiconductor and display sector to prepare for possible overseas export regulations, (2) industry-specific policies be created to address emission characteristics that differ from those in other industries, and (3) differentiated support policies be designed to reduce emissions not only in major corporations but also in small and medium-sized supply chain companies.",
        "Environmental pollution by Petroleum refinery wastewater (PRW) raises vital call for attention to scientist and industrialists due to its impact on human and eco-system. This manuscript reviews methods on modification of semiconductors, effect of operating parameters, reusability/stability, along with recent development on TiO2- and ZnO-based photocatalysts towards degradation of PRW pollutants. TiO2 and ZnO can be successfully modified to visible/solar light responsive photocatalysts. In-depth knowledge of reaction mechanism between photocatalysts and sorbates, structure formation in modified photocatalysts with respect to generation/mobilization of photo-charged carriers, informs the choice of composition of photocatalysts. Petroleum refineries are yet to benefit from heterogeneous photocatalysis due to some setbacks such as: recovery of photocatalysts for reuse, inability of the catalyst to degrade high concentration of pollutants, inability to handle the complex nature of PRW, and its reusability. Thus, a multifunctional and cost effective photocatalyst with reusability/stability needs more exploration to enable commercialization of the photocatalysts.",
        "Accurate estimation of solar radiation components of a specific location has been one of the most important issues of solar energy applications. In this paper, a new approach, named Weighted Gaussian Process Regression (WGPR), is developed for multi-step ahead forecasting of daily global and direct horizontal solar radiation components in Saharan climate. The WGPR is tested using global and direct solar radiation data recorded over three years (2013â€“2015) in a semi-arid region in Algeria. It consists of forecasting 10-steps ahead for both components with automatic selection of relevant climatic data. In this respect two different architectures of WGPR are proposed, WGPR Parallel Forecasting Architecture (WGPR-PFA) and WGPR Cascade Forecasting Architecture (WGPR-CFA). The proposed approach proved to be effective with respect to the basic GPR in terms of accuracy and processing time for daily global and direct solar radiation forecasting. Forecasting with WGPR-CFA led to error RMSEâ€¯=â€¯3.18 (MJ/m2) and correlation coefficient r2â€¯=â€¯85.85 (%) for the 10th daily global horizontal radiation, and RMSEâ€¯=â€¯5.23 (MJ/m2) and correlation coefficient r2â€¯=â€¯56.21(%) for 10th daily direct horizontal radiation. The achieved results specify that the developed WGPR approach can be adjudged as an efficient machine learning model for accurate forecasting of solar radiation components.",

The oxygen groups on either side of GO basal plane can be functioned as the anchor by employing GO as scaffolds. Vanadium-oxo nanosheets (VON) were assembled onto the surface of GO material from homogeneously dissolved VO(acac)2 solution via a facile route. Control experiments with different methods prepared graphene materials illustrate the nucleation and fabrication process of VON on GO surface with detailed TEM and XPS investigation.

        "Solar energy exploitation is one of the most important weapons for facing the recent environmental and energy management dangers. Concentrating solar collectors can produce useful heat in medium and high-temperature levels. So, they can be used in a great variety of applications as space-cooling, industrial heat, chemical processes and electricity production. The use of nanofluids is one of the most effective ways for enhancing the performance of the concentrating collectors. In this paper, the use of nanofluids as working fluids in concentrating solar collectors is investigated in detail.

        "Assessment of solar potential over a location of interest is introduced as an important step for the successful planning of solar energy systems (photovoltaic or thermal). Due to the absence of meteorological stations and sophisticated solar sensors, solar data may be unavailable for every point of interest. Hence, empirical and intelligence methods are developed to estimate solar irradiance data. In this study, the idea of artificial intelligence methods is employed to predict the daily global solar radiation. The developed models are: group method of data handling (GMDH) type neural network, multilayer feed-forward neural network (MLFFNN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), ANFIS optimized with particle swarm optimization algorithm (ANFIS-PSO), ANFIS optimized with genetic algorithm (ANFIS-GA) and ANFIS optimized with ant colony (ANFIS-ACO). The data are collected from 12 stations in different climate zones of Iran. The input variables of the models are including month, day, average air temperature, maximum air temperature, minimum air temperature, air pressure, relative humidity, wind speed, top of atmosphere insolation, latitude and longitude. The results demonstrated that although the developed models can successfully predict the global horizontal irradiance, the GMDH model outperforms the other developed models. The values of root mean square error (RMSE), determination coefficient (R2) and mean square error (MSE) for the GMDH model were 0.2466 (kWh/m2/day), 0.9886 and 0.0608 (kWh/m2/day), respectively.",
        "Photocatalysts are usually confined in a substrate to prevent their dispersion and facilitate their subsequent removal from the environmental compartment after remediation, thus, resulting in portable and â€œgreenâ€ photocatalytic platforms. If the substrate is well designed, it can retain target pollutants close to the photocatalyst particles increasing photocatalytic efficiency.

        "The objective of this study was to use a statistical approach to determine the correlation of fixed carbon, volatile matters and moisture with the specific electrical consumption and exergy efficiency by collecting and analyzing an abundance of actual production data generated in silicon plants during the melting process of silicon produced in the submerged arc furnace (SAF). A high positive correlation (the r maximum value of 0.82) between the fixed carbon composition and the specific electrical consumption, as well as the perfect negative correlation (the r maximum value ofÂ âˆ’0.92) between the fixed carbon and the exergy efficiency were found, especially when the carbon materials contained a very high amount of graphitized carbon. Compared with the carbon materials without woodchips, the high correlation among the volatile matters, the specific electrical consumption and exergy efficiency was observed when using the carbon materials with woodchips. The influence of the proximate composition on the electrical consumption and exergy efficiency becomes stronger with the increase of the graphitized carbon content in the carbon materials. The analysis results can be used to support decisions when optimizing the proximate composition of the carbonaceous reductants in order to increase exergy efficiency and decrease electrical consumption costs, which is one of the biggest operating costs in the silicon furnace.",
        "Insulating layer of photovoltaic (PV) modules is subject to irradiation-induced ageing that can affect their security, stability and lifetime. Early potential induced degradation phenomena were founded in the insulating Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) backsheet of photovoltaic module. However, the designed lifetime of PET insulating backsheet is inconsistent with their practical service time. We have found that the corona discharge in the air provides consistent relative degradation behavior, and that crystallinity values can vary based on different electron avalanche duration. Surface charge evacuation phenomena of PET under varied corona discharge time were also tested. An increase tendency between the chemical degradation and the elevated electron irradiation was investigated.

In this paper, the PET samples were polarized under a corona discharge configuration. Moreover, the surface potential induced by surface charge accumulation effect were tested. A DSC measurement was conducted on these samples. As a result, the bell shaped surface charge distribution and three DSC curves were provided.

        "Nanofluids are the most attractive mean to enhance the performance of heat transfer devices. Several types of nanoparticles were utilized as they have high thermal conductivity. Renewable energy makes use of these nanofluids special in solar collectors. Evacuated tube solar collector is one of the most utilized solar collectors in thermal applications. CeO2 nanoparticles were used in the presented study. The mean diameter of CeO2 was 25â€¯nm. A stable CeO2/water was made. The stability was checked using Zeta potential machine. Experiments were carried out using three different volume concentration of CeO2 nanoparticles of 0.015%, 0.025%, and 0.035%. The thermal performance of the evacuated tube solar collector was examined at different mass flux rates. Results showed that the temperature difference between inlet and outlet flow and absorbed energy increase when nanofluids are used. The volume fraction flow rate of 0.035% at the mass flux rate of 0.017â€¯kg/s.m2 had the maximum heat removable factor, the thermo-optical characteristic of the collector, and the thermal loss coefficient. The thermo-optical characteristic of the collector of tube solar corrector is raised up to 34%.",
        "In electromagnetic directional solidification, the silicon phase cannot always be completely separated, resulting in considerable waste of power and silicon. This study investigated the electromagnetic separation of silicon by using electromagnetic induction-heated directional solidification furnaces at varying frequencies. Two frequencies were applied to separate silicon from aluminumâ€“silicon melts. Numerical simulation results indicated that a low frequency (3â€¯kHz) could substantially enhance the separation of silicon from aluminumâ€“silicon melts under an alternating electromagnetic field, which could increase the speed of the melts to 0.92â€¯cm/s. Experimental results showed that separation efficiency could exceed 85% at a pulling rate of 10â€¯Î¼m/s when a furnace at a frequency of 3â€¯kHz was used. This method can potentially meet the requirements of manufacturing low-cost solar cells for industrial use.",
        "Unique and infrequent strategy to greenly synthesize silver imprinted zinc oxide nanoparticles (AgZnO NPs) is presented. A facile and low cost phytosynthetic route using guava leaves aqueous extract succeeded in decorating commercial ZnO with Ag nanoparticles without needing environmentally undesirable chemical reagents. The AgZnO NPs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) spectrophotometry/spectrofluorimetry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Band gap calculations of Ag(2.5mol%)/ZnO give estimate of (3.03â€¯eV) compared to 3.25â€¯eV for ZnO. indicating good capacity of visible light absorption. This improves the solar energy harvesting characteristics of the phyto-developed AgZnO NPs. Moreover, the photocatalytic efficacy of AgZnO NPs is tested in detoxification of methylene blue (MB) enriched aqueous solutions. Parameters affecting the photodegradation rate like catalyst dosage, amount of Ag loading and pH were investigated and optimized. Under â‰ˆ18â€¯min of sunlight-irradiation (800â€¯W/m2), over 22â€¯mg/L of alkaline solution of MB can be efficiently photomineralized using 0.4â€¯g of Ag(2.5%)/ZnO NPs.

        "Increased environmental and economic awareness, coupled with local government incentives, means that solar energy applications in buildings are crucial to sustainable urban development and commercial energy investment. Considering the large available areas on building rooftops and walls, and the application of building-integrated photovoltaic products, previous research has paid extensive attention to solar radiation estimation for roofs and vertical walls. This paper proposes a developed pixel method integrated with Net Present Value (NPV) analysis and applies the measurement to 3D visualisation of the revenue distribution of potential PV projects on building surfaces, including vertical and non-vertical facades. A building model derived from a real student accommodation building is then chosen as a case study in this paper. The developed algorithm extracts data built in SketchUp, exports instantaneous shadow images and estimates solar energy potential over building surfaces for each pixel unit. Coloured 3D radiation maps illustrate the distribution of solar energy potential on roofs and facades. 3D contour lines with NPVs are introduced to visually conduct PV installation strategies with desirable revenues over project lifetimes. The results reveal that facade installation is also worthwhile, as the corresponding project revenues are competitive with rooftop installation during specific periods. This study will benefit designers and construction managers in determining the optimal solution for implementing solar rooftop and facade systems in the design and construction phases.",
        "Global warming is a worldwide problem that requires an international strategy to ensure compatibility of economic growth and overcoming climate change. Although global use of low-carbon technology is a solution, consideration of economic consequences is important to promote future technology development and use. Photovoltaic (PV) solar power system is a promising renewable technology that carries climate mitigation expectations. We conducted a value chain analysis to evaluate the economic effect of the manufacture and use of silicon PV solar power system worldwide. We quantitatively reviewed the flow of manufacturing and installation for cells, modules, and facilities (e.g., inverters) related to Japan, and estimated the retrospectively induced economic costs for Japan and other developed and developing countries. Material, equipment, labor, utility, transportation, and business operation costs were studied in detail at different manufacturing and installation stages. This unique evaluation methodology quantified economic costs from an international perspective. The retrospectively induced economic effect of 2014â€¯PV solar power system sales in Japan (induced by cell module and system production by Japanese companies and increased domestic use) was 1.6 trillion Japanese yen worldwide, of which 63% was attributable to Japan, 10% to other developed countries, and 27% to developing countries. The economic effect in Japan in terms of equipment cost and installation stage was 37% and 71% of the total effect, which was particularly high. Further technical improvement, cost reduction, and improvement in inverter and manufacturing equipment reliability are important to capitalize Japan's strengths. Currently, Japan's involvement in the manufacturing of cells and modules is small. Therefore, both technical innovation and cost reduction are necessary. We present new methodology to obtain inputs into policy development for further research, development, and technology diffusion.",
        "In this work, Cufe12O19 nanoparticles were successfully synthesized using amino acids as non-toxic reagents. To achieve the desired sample with high homogeneity and the fine size, various parameters such as calcination temperature, molar ratios of Cu+2 to Fe+3 and Cu+2 to amino acid were changed. The products were characterized by SEM, TEM, EDS, XRD and FT-IR and the optical and magnetic properties were studied by DRS and VSM analyses. Furthermore, carbon-based nanocomposites of Cufe12O19 were prepared and the effect of carbon nanotube and graphene on the properties of this hexaferrite was investigated. Improving the electrochemical properties, shifting the absorption edge to higher energy and increasing the photocatalytic activity were the results of preparation of these nanocomposites. The high surface area induced by CNT and graphene as substrates of nanocomposites led to increase the photocatalytic activities of these composites under UV irradiation. According to the results, photocatalytic activity of graphene-based nanocomposites was better and degradation percent of Erythrosine as an anionic dye was more than the other dyes. The photocatalytic reactions followed the pseudo-first order kinetic model.",
        "This study demonstrates the synthesis of TiO2 nanosheets (TNST) exhibiting high percentage (54%) of exposed (001) facets and decorated with co-deposited gold and platinum nanoparticles (NPs). The as synthesized as well as modified sheets are then investigated for the photo-reduction of water under sunlight irradiation using different alcohols as hole-scavengers. Structural and morphological studies manifest the formation of well-defined sheet structure of TiO2 with average dimensions of 55â€¯nmâ€¯Ã—â€¯46â€¯nm. The measured d spacing of 0.34â€¯nm and 0.23â€¯nm corresponds to (101) and (001) facets of anatase TiO2. The presence of Au and Pt was confirmed by electron diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. TiO2 nanosheets (TNST's) with 0.4 and 0.75â€¯wt % of Au and Pt (Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNSTs), respectively were found to exhibit higher efficiency. Furthermore, photo-electrochemical (PEC) water splitting studies revealed the increase in photocurrent from 2â€¯mAâ€¯at 0.5â€¯V to 4.5â€¯mAâ€¯at 0.65â€¯V for Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST photoelectrodes, which otherwise was 0.15â€¯mA for the bare TNST photoelectrodes at the same potential. The observed PEC performance was well supported by impedance analysis, wherein Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNSTs (338â€¯Î©) are found to exhibit lower resistance in comparison to bare TNST (737â€¯Î©), which could be due to brilliant photo conductance and interfacial charge transfer properties of Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNSTs. Photocatalytically the Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST produced âˆ¼143â€¯Î¼molâ€¯h1 of H2 gas under direct sunlight irradiation, which is found equivalent to 16.1% apparent quantum efficiency.",
        "The characteristics and applications of carbonaceous materials play a vital role in silicon production using an electric arc furnace, as this is an energy-intensive industry with high energy operating costs that is currently facing severe challenges to become more sustainable and more competitive. In this study, the effect of different carbon materials on specific electrical consumption and the exergetic efficiency and the silicon yield for two types of furnace was investigated using a statistical analysis method based on actual production data from the silicon plant. The highest exergetic efficiency values of 0.39 (8.3Â MVA) and 0.42 (12.5Â MVA) without recovery were obtained by the application of petcoke and charcoal. The exergetic efficiency was higher in the larger capacity furnace than in the smaller furnace for the same consumption of raw materials. The correlation between exergetic efficiency and carbon materials was evaluated and revealed that the moisture content and graphitization of raw materials have a significant effect on the exergetic efficiency. The reactivity of mixtures was improved by synergistic interactions between petcoke and coal or woodchips, which increased the carbothermic reduction utilization of silica based on the higher silicon yield indicator, but reduced the exergetic efficiency and silicon actual production, as it increased the specific electrical consumption.",
        "As photovoltaic industry has entered the fast development period with the advent of the energy crisis, concentrating photovoltaic technology has been one of the important options among renewable energy technologies. A high concentrating photovoltaic/thermal (HCPV/T) module has been experimentally studied and compared with the HCPV module. The experimental results indicate that the HCPV/T module shows better performance with 26.5% electrical efficiency and additional 49.3% thermal efficiency. Meanwhile, both of the numerical thermal and electrical models have been built to investigate the characteristics of the HCPV/T system. The temperature coefficient of photovoltaic cell efficiency isÂ âˆ’0.054%/Â°C, and the drop in system electrical efficiency with temperature isÂ âˆ’0.042%/Â°C. Analysis of the temperature coefficient of the system efficiency indicates that the overall efficiency is not sensitive to the coolant temperature. The results are expected to contribute to a better design and performance of HCPV/T systems, which have promising potential applications in the clean production.",
        "Solar grade silicon (SiSG) is typically used in photovoltaic applications, and it is commercially manufactured via the Siemens process. Despite the fact that current levels of demand are satisfied, there may be a shortage of SiSG in the near future. To improve the low yield of the Siemens process, two alternative types of SiSG production processes have been developed and analyzed using a stochastic optimization scheme within ASPEN PLUS. The first one is an intensified Fluidized Bed Reactor (FBR) process using a reactive distillation column. The second one is a hybrid process combining both the Siemens and the conventional FBR processes. In addition to supplying future demand, these processes are intended to reduce the use of raw materials. The results show the great value of optimizing the processes, since it achieves savings in the TAC of 53.28%, 67.65% and 62.58% (Siemens, Intensified FBR and Hybrid process), respectively. Siemens process shows the lowest TAC ($0.50Â M/y), but this does not mean that it is the process with the highest potential, since it has the lowest silicon production rate, 0.47Â kt/y. The Intensified FBR Union Carbide Process turns out to be the most expensive of the three ($2.57Â M/y), with a large production of Si(SG), 1.49Â kt/y. However, it is the hybrid process which shows the larger yield by far, with a production of 1.89Â kt/y of Si(SG) and TAC of $1.95Â M/y, showing the highest profit from sales, $40.47Â M/y. However, from the environmental point of view, the Siemens process shows the lowest environmental impact based on the eco-indicator 99, while the Hybrid process is the second best.",
        "Life cycle assessment on monocrystalline silicon (mono-Si) solar photovoltaic (PV) cell production in China is performed in the present study, aiming to evaluate the environmental burden, identify key factors, and explore approaches for potential environmental improvement. Results show that the impact generated from the categories of human toxicity, marine ecotoxicity, and metal depletion contribute dominantly to the overall environmental burden because of silver (Ag) paste, electricity, and glass consumption. The energy payback time and greenhouse gas emission range from 0.42 to 0.91 years and 5.60â€“12.07Â g CO2 eq/kWh respectively, both of which are lower than the previously reported results in studies in Europe, the United States, and Asia. However, compared with coal-based electricity generation that uses ultra-supercritical technology, the environmental payback time in human toxicity, marine ecotoxicity, and metal depletion categories is quite high because of the direct air emissions of lead, arsenic, mercury, copper, and nickel, as well as the use of Ag. Additionally, utilization of PV systems in regions with high solar radiation values has a high potential environmental benefit from PV systems. "
        "The design of new systems with Donorâ€“Acceptor properties is of great interest for the construction of optoelectronic new devices. Considering the strong supramolecular interaction of triazines with graphene a series of imine-derived triazines with Donorâ€“Acceptor properties have been designed. These compounds have been prepared in good to excellent yields (47â€“92%) using Green conditions, i.e. microwave irradiation in the absence of an acid catalyst. Their properties as Donorâ€“Acceptor systems have been studied by Ultravioletâ€“visible and fluorescence spectroscopy and by electrochemical studies. These imine derived triazines are blue-violet emitters (ca. 396Â nm) and show large Stokes shifts (c.a. 6700Â cmâˆ’1) and the electrochemical studies shows a high degree of communication between the acceptor triazines and the donor moieties (oxidation potentials up to 1.10Â V). These characteristics makes them excellent candidates for the interaction with graphene and the construction of optoelectronic devices, as blue Light Emitting-Diodes (LEDs).",
        " Atomic layer deposition (ALD), as a key enabling nano-manufacturing technology, has found a wide range of potential applications in a number of industrial sectors. However, due to the binary reaction and self-limiting nature of the ALD process, its life cycle environmental impact is significant but has never been investigated before. This study is conducted using a hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) approach for evaluating the comprehensive environmental impacts of the ALD process based on the typical ALD of Al2O3 high-k dielectric gate on semiconductors. The hybrid life cycle inventory analysis is conducted using process-based LCA data, economic inputâ€“output LCA data, and stoichiometric simulation data for a robust LCA study. The impact assessments are conducted using the TRACI method, with both original and U.S. normalized impact results analyzed. Normalized impact results show that, among the twelve selected impact categories, ALD produces the highest impact in the category of fossil fuels use which is 108 times that of the least impact in air acidification potential. Significant differences are also observed among the environmental impacts of the ALD life cycle stages. The environmental impacts associated with the auxiliary infrastructure, equipment, and tools for ALD operation are intensive mainly due to the slow ALD cycling process. This hybrid LCA study provides a comprehensive data support for understanding the potential environmental impacts of ALD nanotechnology and is useful for sustainable scale-up of the ALD technology in future.",

        "Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been proved to act as a desirable tool to evaluate the environmental impacts of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). However, the application of LCA methodology in the field of wastewater treatment is still in progress. This paper has made a review of the LCA studies dealing with biological (activated sludge) WWTPs, with the aim to provide qualitative interpretation of the associated environmental impact categories: eutrophication potential, global warming potential, toxicity-related impacts, energy balance, water use, land use and other impact categories. Possible sources for each impact category of WWTPs are summarized in order to provide information about the critical aspects in WWTP systems that might influence LCA results. Moreover, recent development and the application status of characterization models for each impact category have been reviewed. The analysis indicates that it is important to carry out site-specific LCA studies on WWTPs. The specificity is most typical for the eutrophication potential and toxicity-related impact categories, which need implementation of spatial differentiated characterization methods, considering the emission location, spatial dimensions (transfer between environmental compartments) and even properties of pollutants. Although remarkable progresses have been obtained, their applications in the field of wastewater treatment are still limited. For the global warming potential impact category, it is most crucial to calculate accurately the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, because nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4), as well as fossil origin carbon dioxide (CO2) in wastewater have the potential to make considerable contributions. In the end, prospective is made about which aspects in WWTPs are candidates for further LCA studies. Overall, there is still room for pursuing more accurate results when applying LCA to WWTPs",

It produces significant results both for independent and combined water and energy integration  Savings up to 71% for heating and 86% for cooling can be achieved by standalone energy integration and savings up to 38% for water consumption by applying independent water integration. On the other hand, combined energy and water integration can lead to 74.5% energy and 36% water savings, thus an increase of 3.5% in energy savings at the expense of just 2% reduction in water savings.",

        "Environmental pollution, especially the pure water scarcity, is an emerging global threat. Various organic pollutants are being detected in all water samples, which harmfully affect all living organisms. In addition, the most commonly applied water purification techniques are insufficient. Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a convincing alternative however, the most frequently used photocatalysts (ZnO or TiO2) have some serious drawbacks. The possible solution lays on nanotechnology yet, the general nanosynthesis pathways require intensive use of chemicals, which is additionally polluting the nature. Following the main aspects of green chemistry is essential.

        "In the present study, dead biomass of marine macro algae, Kappaphycus alverezii (K.Â alverezii) was used for the removal of phosphate from water. The effect of different parameters such as contact time, adsorbate concentration, biosorbent dose and temperature was investigated. The biosorption kinetics data were best described by the pseudo-second order rate equation, and equilibrium was achieved after 80Â min. The phosphate biosorption was governed by film diffusion process. The maximum phosphate biosorption on K. alverezii was 59.77Â mg/g at 25Â Â°C and it followed the Redlich-Peterson model. The biosorption on K. alverezii increased with increasing temperature and was the highest at pH 6.0. The calculated thermodynamic parameters (Î”GÂ°, Î”HÂ° and Î”SÂ°) showed that the biosorption of phosphate onto K. alverezii biomass was feasible, spontaneous and endothermic at 15â€“45Â Â°C. Results suggest that the prepared biomass of K.Â alverezii has potential in remediation of phosphate contaminated waters.",
        "The population growth of cities increases the generation of construction building waste (CBW) and wastewater and, respectively, their environmental impacts. The present study shows a new technology to manage of the sewage and construction wastes from Campinas city, Brazil, based on the ecological cost accounting theory. In this way, the treatment of the crude sewage from Anhumas Wastewater Treatment Plant was made by decantation using the construction building waste. The organic amendment was obtained from the decanted sludge, which has been used in the recovery of a poor soil. From the supernatant liquid was obtained the reusing water, which has been tested in irrigation process. The efficiencies of the organic amendment and reusing water have been assessed by the quantity of the germinated bean seeds on the poor soil. Results show that the best condition to organic amendment production was the one in which a total soil layer of 2Â cm and 100Â mL/L of CBW were used, which yielded a gain in soil fertility of 11.11%. It was verified that 85% of bean seeds have been germinated on soil, when it irrigated these seeds with the reusing water, being 6% larger than control water. All parameters of lower water quality were reduced above of 90%, keeping the water in according to Brazilian standards. The cost evaluation of reusing water and organic amendment production shows a saving of US$ 81.1 million, indicating the social, ecological and economical viabilities of the new technology developed and demonstrated in this work. In that sense, this work provided a possible environmental solver based on the ecological cost accounting theory for the city of Campinas, Brazil.",
        "Since water pollution associated with high concentrations of nitrate poses serious threats to aquatic ecosystems and can eventually lead to eutrophication, the removal of nitrate, particularly in a large scale context is still a challenge. To address it, this study proposed that iron nanoparticles (Fe NPs) synthesized by green tea (GT-Fe) and eucalyptus leaves (EL-Fe) extracts, which regarded as cleaner productions can be used for the efficient removal of nitrate. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) confirmed the successful synthesis of spheroidal iron nanoparticles. Meanwhile, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer (FTIR) indicated the formation of Fe0-iron oxide core-shell NPs with polyphenols as a capping/stabilizing agent. Batch experiment showed that 59.7% and 41.4% of nitrate was removed by GT-Fe and EL-Fe NPs, compared to the 87.6% and 11.7% that was removed using zero-valent iron nanoparticles (nZVI) and Fe3O4 nanoparticles, respectively. Nevertheless, reactivity of nZVI decreased 2.1-fold after being aged in air for two months, whilst GT-Fe and EL-Fe NPs almost remain the same. Additionally, the kinetics study indicated that the nitrate removal process better fitted to the pseudo-second-order adsorption model, where the q e was 13.06Â mg/g for GT-Fe and 9.698Â mg/g for EL-Fe NPs. Based above, a removal mechanism dominated by adsorption and co-precipitation process with subsequently reduction was proposed. Finally, applications of these as-prepared green Fe NPs in swine wastewater demonstrated a promising environmental pollution management option for large scale eutrophic wastewater treatment.",
        "Reduction of costs incurred for supplying water and heating it for household purposes is possible by means of an application of systems recovering heat from drain water in combination with water flow limiters. Then, not only advantageous financial results can be obtained, but also positive effects in the form of reduced use of fossil fuels, improved air quality, and limited water consumption. This paper presents a calculation model that allows to assess the synergy of financial effects for different variants of an investment project consisting in mounting a water flow limiter and a DWHR unit in a shower system of a single-family building. This model has a large application potential that can be used as a tool facilitating the decision-making process both in the system design and modernization stage. A simulation test carried out for the case study involving different variants of modernization of a household shower system shows that profitability of such investment depends on the adopted modernization variant and system usage parameters. The best financial performance characterizes variants involving the use of a water flow limiter or both devices. The mounting of both devices becomes the most advantageous when the shower taking time is long. The obtained results additionally show that the most favorable financial effects can be achieved in buildings in which the total time of using shower facilities is the longest. The application of the presented solutions will be, therefore, particularly profitable in case of buildings characterized with significant water consumption and high rotation of users.",
        "Today, advanced treatment units are widely suggested for industrial wastewater reuse as a non-conventional water resource in the developing countries positioned in arid/semi-arid areas. However, the sustainability of these units still remains blur due to the lack of a proper framework and availability of the collected data or experiences. The present study aimed to propose a framework for assessing the sustainability of advanced hybrid treatment systems through three major steps: (1) describing feasible alternatives and defining evaluation procedure (modified analytical hierarchy process); (2) elaborating the decision making process including 32 proposed integrated indices (8 sub-criteria and 4 criteria) and defining five possible scenarios and finally (3) prioritizing the alternatives, finding the best answer and making a sensitive analysis. The framework was proposed by recommending 8 alternatives for industrial parks in Iran as the case study. The results indicated that the weights of the economic and technological criteria could play a significant role when these systems were experienced as a new practice in difficult or poor situations. However, by improving the situation from â€œTransitionâ€ to â€œIdealâ€, other aspects such as environmental and social criteria were regarded as major concerns. In addition, alternative 5 and 6 as two hybrid system were determined as high rank for five relevant defined scenarios. Alternative 6 was regarded as the best answer with the highest average score by regarding all of the scenarios. Finally, based on sensitivity, the best answer relies on the variation in the criteria weights.",
        "South Africa is a semi-arid developing country facing water and energy insecurity. There are colossal challenges in reliably providing these resources amid growing population, increased urbanization and improved living standards causing increased demand for these resources. Development of new supply centralized systems comes at an exorbitant cost, whereas decentralized systems are touted as an attractive alternative. Grey water recycling and rain water harvesting at buildings level is such an alternative that can provide water for non-potable uses. However, there are technological challenges of optimally operating such systems while ensuring efficient use of associated energy. This paper introduces two control strategies; open loop optimal control and closed-loop model predictive control (MPC) strategies aimed at ensuring safe and reliable operation of the grey water recycling and rain water harvesting system while efficiently using associated energy. From the case study, the proposed system with either control strategy can save the cost of water and waste water by up to 32.3% and 29.5% respectively, while leading to 35.7% in energy cost savings and 31.5% in total operational cost savings in a month. Adoption of these systems would have a huge environmental effect in reducing demand for sewerage services, conservation of water hence reducing demand for potable water as well as increasing the energy efficiency. Furthermore, the system would increase the reliability and security of water supply. Despite the benefits, the system does not pay within its lifetime and therefore, government intervention is required so as to make it economically attractive. High cost of implementation coupled with low potable and waste water tariffs harbour adoption of these systems. Appropriate regulations, policies, incentives and public education are necessary to support such novel technologies in ensuring resource conservation, efficiency and security are achieved.",
        "Wastewater treatment facilities are increasingly being considered as centralized installations where various resources can be recovered from the sewage. Novel technological solutions are already available for achieving this goal. However, their application to upgrade existing plants can be far more challenging than building new dedicated plants. While the scientific literature is generally focused on testing and comparing the recovery options, this work was aimed at giving a holistic evaluation of the actual impacts of upgrading existing facilities. Commercially available systems were considered for retrofitting two plants of different size (50,000 and 500,000 population equivalents) and achieving either energy self-sufficiency or material recovery. Based on mass and energy balances, a detailed evaluation of technical, social, economic, and administrative aspects was carried out. Environmental aspects were also included, adopting a simplified approach. It turned out that energy self-sufficiency (external energy supply reduced down to about 10% of the total need) is not far away to be achieved, with moderate techno-economic implications, especially when the plant is already equipped with primary sedimentation and anaerobic digestion. Integral recovery of treated effluent, sludge and nitrogen can also be pursued in large facilities, while several potential criticalities arise for medium-sized plants. The adopted procedure evidenced critical aspects that are often disregarded in the decision process: this may suggest where to address efforts in evaluating real situations.",
        "Current wastewater treatment biomeasures are dominated by single microbial species, which can only decolorize low concentrations (â‰¤150Â mgÂ Lâˆ’1) of crystal violet (CV). Considering the advantages of microbial aggregates, with micro-porous structure and complete hierarchical trophic communities, several innovative bioreactors based on periphyton (i.e. epiphyton, metaphyton and epilithon) were examined. The results showed that periphyton could tolerate high concentration of CV (1000Â mgÂ Lâˆ’1) and the immobilized periphyton bioreactors could completely decolorize up to 1000Â mgÂ Lâˆ’1 of CV within 168Â h showing 50â€“100% removal by bioreactors. The removal of CV was a synergistic process accomplished by adsorption (with insignificant desorption) followed by the dominant mechanism of biodegradation. The CV was converted into non-toxic aliphatic compounds in the presence of periphyton. Phytotoxicity and microbial toxicity tests showed that biodegradation of CV did not produce any toxic secondary metabolite, leading to environmentally benign effluents meeting the standards of agricultural irrigation. These results provide an insight into the processes involved in removing CV by periphyton or similar microbial aggregates, and indicate the potential of periphyton as a green material to purify water contaminated by high concentrations of CV.",
        "Low-cost materials and low-tech architectures could give competitive advantage in scaling-up applications of microbial fuel cells (MFC), especially for nutrients recovery from wastewater. Here a novel concept is presented, based on cylindrical ligno-cellulosic materials, available as agricultural residues or spontaneous vegetation. Giant canes (Arundo Donax L.) and maize (Zea Mays) stalks were used as porous separators (naturally tubular) for air-cathode MFC modules (GC-MFC and MS-MFC, meaning Giant Cane and Maize Stalk, respectively), with carbon cloth-based electrodes. The MFCs were operated across 100Â Î© external load, enriching swine-farming wastewater with addition of sodium acetate (3Â gÂ Lâˆ’1). Initially, these systems showed relatively high internal resistances (especially GC, with R int =Â 5600Â Î©), before the material was completely imbibed by the anolyte. After 10â€“20 days acclimation, despite sufficient electrolytic conductivity was established in both systems (internal resistance around 60â€“90Â Î©), relatively low power densities (around 40Â mWÂ mâˆ’2, normalized by cathode's surface projection) were achieved, if compared to state-of-the-art MFCs, oriented to electricity harvesting. However, the generated electric field was enough to sustain electro-osmotic ions mobility and to establish high pH conditions (pH 11â€“12) at the cathode. Over 70 days of operation, electro-migration and deposition phenomena of valuable elements (Na, Ca, Mg, Mn, K, etc.) were observed, both inside the separator and on the cathode surface. Simultaneously, partial biodegradation of the ligno-cellulosic biomass, especially for MS, drove partial release of organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and other elements in the anodic chamber. These relevant phenomena have to be taken into account in view of possible applications of ligno-cellulosic materials in MFC-driven nutrients recovery from wastewater.",
        "As arid regions face increasing pressures on their water resources, the challenge of securing an adequate supply of good quality water to meet growing demands calls for innovative approaches that involve a diversification of water supply options and improved management of wastewater. Water recycling is a disruptive innovation that can help to achieve this goal in arid countries if the appropriate technical and institutional barriers are broken down. Within the water innovation literature, key questions remain as to the nature of the process and of the temporal dynamics of a shift towards decentralized wastewater infrastructure. This study offers insights into these mechanics using the Framework for Analyzing a Multi-level Innovation System (FAMIS), a cross-sectoral model that draws on the theories of technological innovation systems, system dynamics, transitions of socio-technical regimes, and evolutionary theories of technology. Cases from three water-scarce countries with distinct political economiesâ€”Australia, the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) and Jordanâ€”were used to document the dynamics of innovation in the water recycling system and identify policy solutions. Despite important contextual differences, in the three cases examined, actors and institutions have dynamically interacted to create a small niche where water recycling has emerged as a viable technology. Yet the application of the FAMIS model revealed that the dominant regime of water management has not been fundamentally altered due to blockages mainly at two â€œstagesâ€ of the FAMIS innovation lifecycle: the selection and adoption stages. We identified cross-geographical socio-technical and environmental characteristics and common mechanisms that strongly influence the evolution of water recycling technology through the innovation system. We find that the water-recycling technology evolves into the later stages of the innovation system in Australia, with the chokepoint occurring most importantly within the sophisticated but fragmented institutions that regulate water recycling. In the U.A.E., while agricultural reuse is widespread (to a larger extent than in Australia), major barriers occur earlier in the system, leaving mainly the water recycling technologies in the early stages of the system, where policy-induced path dependency block most selection mechanisms. With a wider infrastructural and institutional gap, Jordan may actually face less stringent barriers to water-recycling developments throughout all stages of the innovation system, namely influenced by international donors. Policy recommendations derived from this work to address barriers at the selection and adoption stages include favoring a coordinated institutional long-term vision and planning to overcome path dependence, enhancing social acceptance and adequate implementation of laws and regulations, and supporting data acquisition and model developments to build a stronger business case for water recycling.",
        "Sludge is slowly moving away from providing basic by-products and towards providing value-added products (e.g. fertilisers); therefore, it is no longer perceived as waste but as a product. Consequently, wastewater treatment plants become multifunctional systems that produce two coproducts that are given a second life: sludge and â€œcleanâ€ water. An allocation factor in Life Cycle Assessment can partition environmental burdens of wastewater treatment between these two products, but doing so remains highly challenging. To address this challenge, we followed a four-step procedure to develop an allocation factor using a mesoscopic approach and process- and product-related parameters in a mathematical model. The first two steps consisted of determining and mathematically representing process- and product-related parameters and their associations to define a global allocation factor. The third step consisted of constructing a corrective inventory matrix to adjust the global allocation factor, since inventory flows can be specific to certain processes. The last step consisted of mathematical modelling of the final corrected allocation factor. Based on the parameters chosen, the global allocation factor equalled 45% for sludge and 55% for water. A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the sludge allocation factor, which varied from 39 to 49%. The allocation factor developed reflects technological performances of the system and considers environmental impacts of sludge production to assess environmental impacts of value-added sludge-based products.",
        "Reclaiming of wastewaters contaminated by heavy metals has become a major challenge over the last decades. For this reason, nanoporous membrane processes have awaken the interest of industry and local community, and the possible ways to improve their performances has become a priority goal for researchers. Metal removal enhancement by polymer addition is a potential way that is deeply investigated herein on nickel ion rejection with chitosan and carboxymethyl cellulose addition. Due to the vanishing of electrostatic interactions induced by the large amount of salt usually contained in effluents, ion rejection consequently drastically drops. However, it is highlighted that a sufficient addition of polymer (higher than 10âˆ’2Â M of monomer unit) can offset this decrease and allow good metal removal, while permeation flux is reduced by increased viscosity. Performances are greatly affected by the pH of the filtered solution whose increase notably improves the metal rejection. Finally, ultrafiltration of an industrial discharge water with and without chitosan enhancement step shows that the rejection increase generated by the polymer addition is very low due to the competing phenomenon between the various species present in the complex mixture.",
        "The use of phytoremediation systems to enhance the treatment of industrial wastewater coming from a standard depuration process in order to allow their reuse can potentially lead to several interesting benefits (costs savings for depuration processes, freshwater and energy supply with a consequent reduction of the overall environmental impact of the industrial sites). In this work the case study of a large automotive plant (FCA plant in Verrone, Piedmont, NW Italy) was analyzed, with the aim of evaluating the possible application of a phytoremediation system (constructed wetland, CW) to treat the effluents of its existing wastewater treatment plant (WWTP, currently discharged into a watercourse) and reuse them in the industrial processes. For this purpose, a pilot CW system was set up with two different configurations horizontal and vertical. Experiments were carried out to identify the one characterized by the best abatement rate of the pollutant concentrations of the plant effluents. Results showed that the horizontal submerged flow system (HF) was the most efficient phytoremediation system suitable for the aging of the effluents of the existing WWTP in view of their possible reuse in the industrial processes. Furthermore, costs related to its scaling-up for a real application demonstrated that the CW can be the cheaper option compared to a traditional treatment process for wastewater reuse. The amount of treated water which may be reused can range from 55% to 80% of the effluents from the existing WWTP, with a consequent reduction of more than 80% in the current water supply from aquifers.

        "Nitrate pollution has attracted increasing attention due to the worsening of water pollution. This study focuses on the synergistic effects of zero-valent iron and bimetallic composite carrier catalyst for maximizing the catalytic reduction of nitrate in water to nitrogen gas. Compared with other conditional catalytic processes, this new technology exhibits a better catalytic efficiency with 70% of N2 selectivity and 0.42Â mg/Lâ€§gâ€§min of catalytic activity under the following conditions: 2Â h reaction time, 4Â g/L zero-valent iron, 3Â g/L catalyst, 3:1 of palladium:tin, 2:1 of Î³-aluminium oxide: diatomite, and 5.2 pH (catalyst: palladium-tin/Î³-aluminium oxide-diatomite). In addition, a kinetic study indicates that this catalytic reaction is well illustrated by the first-order kinetics of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. A study on the catalytic rates of catalysts with six different composite carriers (Î³-aluminium oxide-diatomite, Î³-aluminium oxide-manganese dioxide, Î³-aluminium oxide-kaolin, diatomite-kaolin, diatomite-manganese dioxide, and kaolin-manganese dioxide) shows that the physical-chemical properties of the carriers are an important factor that significantly influences the reaction process. Finally, the regeneration and reuse of six catalysts are further investigated. Acidic washing enhances the catalytic performance more than alkaline washing. However, except for palladium-tin/diatomite and palladium-tin/Î³-aluminium oxide-diatomite, other catalysts after acidic washing remained improved catalytic performance, but, lower than their original catalysts.",
        "Microalgae technology can play important roles in wastewater management, carbon dioxide fixation and as biofuels feedstock if managed properly. The core challenge is to substantially lower the cultivation and harvesting costs. This study assesses performances of batch wise photobioreactor (PBR) and sequencing batch membrane photobioreactor (SB-MPBR) for polishing real secondary effluent, and at the same time producing lipid by cultivating a native strain of Euglena sp. Lab-scale data were used to project large-scale performance of an SB-MPBR and its economic potential was compared with established conventional biological nutrients removal technologies. Results show that the SB-MPBR with 4 days retention was found to be optimum in terms of nutrients removal (â‰¥95% and â‰¥70% respectively for total nitrogen and total phosphorous), water treatment capacity and lipid yield (â‰¥10%). However, an energy audit on the process shows that the chemical energy from the produced lipid is still at least 111 fold short of meeting an energy neutral process. However, results of preliminary cost analysis indicate that SB-MPBR (0.113 $/m3) is highly attractive technology for biological nutrients removal than the conventional technologies (0.65â€“0.96 $/m3).",
        "Cleaner production is an industrial preventive strategy created to promote benefits for the environment and for human beings. Its basic principle lies in using natural energy resources in an efficient way and yet in reducing risks and impacts on the environment and on human beings throughout the life cycle of a product. Electrodialysis is a membrane separation process which uses an electrical potential difference as a driving force to promote ionic separation in aqueous solutions. The technique was initially developed for the production of drinking water from brackish water. However, the use of electrodialysis in the treatment of industrial wastewaters is becoming more attractive, due to its characteristics. The technique is considered a clean process, since it allows the reuse of water and the recovery of substances. In this work, the advancement of electrodialysis applied to cleaner production in electroplating industry will be discussed. The aim of this work is to present electrodialysis as a technology which can fulfill the requirements of cleaner production concepts in the electroplating industry. The research was performed starting from a predefined question: â€œhow is electrodialysis becoming a cleaner production strategy in the electroplating industry?â€. The research was divided in two main themes. The first search was related to the most important cleaner production practices applied for the plating industry. The second search was associated with the electrodialysis application in the electroplating industry. The results obtained from the collected publications were compared in order to propose an answer to the research question. The results showed that almost a half of the published articles evaluated the improvement of the wastewater treatment as a cleaner production strategy to be applied in plating industries. In addition, the wastewater treatment was the most cited application of electrodialysis in the plating industry, especially for copper, nickel and zinc recovery and for chromium VI removal. Results shows that electrodialysis is becoming an important and solid strategy to promote cleaner production in the plating industry. The two most important issues to be improved for this application are the system efficiency for macromolecules and the energy waste when dilute solutions are used. For the latter, the use of hybrid techniques such as electrodeionization was the most evaluated alternative.",
        "Boron (B) removal is a difficult process, and techniques based on conventional methodology mostly remove little or no B from drinking water. Therefore, an attractive, low cost, and environmental friendly treatment method should be tested in order to recover B from drinking water, especially when instillation, operation, and maintenance costs limit treatment applications. Engineered wetland (EW) treatment technologies are effective, economical, and eco-friendly treatment options for wastewater treatment in semi-arid and arid areas in the world. This study presents four new up-flow engineered wetland (UEW) reactors tested with different media types for B removal from drinking water in 120 days treatment period. The results show that significant amount of B is removed from drinking water with UEW, suggesting that using an up-flow mode in EW treatment technology for B removal seems to be an option more effective than those of the other EW system modes. Using Typha latifolia, the present experiment chooses four different filling materials, namely peat, zeolite, volcanic cinder, and sand as media to design wetland reactors. We found that media type affects the removal capacities of wetland reactors and thus B removal efficiency of four reactors are ordered as peat reactor (91%)>volcanic cinder reactor (84%)>sand reactor (83%)>zeolite reactor (57%). Furthermore, results from the present experiment emphasize that the media type also affects the physicochemical parameter, plant uptake, and soil enzyme activities. Consequently, it can be suggested that a well-designed wetland treatment reactor with an up-flow mode and peat media is an effective tool for drinking water treatment in order to obtain higher B removal efficiency.

        "Osmotic microbial fuel cells (OsMFCs) take advantages of synergy between forward osmosis (FO) and microbial fuel cells (MFCs) for simultaneous wastewater treatment, bioenergy production, and water recovery. A unique feature for healthy operation of OsMFCs is an appropriate draw solute (DS) that can also act as a catholyte. Herein, polyelectrolytes (polyacrylic acid sodium salts, PAA-Na) was investigated as a DS/catholyte and reproduced with the aid of the high catholyte pH. Such a reproduction method is innovative, because it turns a drawback (high catholyte pH) into a useful resource, thereby reducing the demand for external input and leading to a clean production process. The results have showed that the OsMFC achieved a current density of 159Â Â±Â 6 A mâˆ’3, water flux of 12.7Â Â±Â 0.2 LMH, and low reverse salt flux of 0.05Â Â±Â 0.00 gMH with 32Â wt% PAA-Na (2000Â Da) as the DS. The DS recovery efficiency could be as high as 99.86Â Â±Â 0.04%, and the reproduced DS was successfully applied in the subsequent operation. With this reproduction method, the highest total operation cost was estimated at 0.104 $ mâˆ’3. Those results have demonstrated a new approach based on pH-dependent PAA DS reproduction towards further development of OsMFC technology for sustainable water/wastewater treatment and resource recovery.

        "Low-cost materials and low-tech architectures could give competitive advantage in scaling-up applications of microbial fuel cells (MFC), especially for nutrients recovery from wastewater. Here a novel concept is presented, based on cylindrical ligno-cellulosic materials, available as agricultural residues or spontaneous vegetation. Giant canes (Arundo Donax L.) and maize (Zea Mays) stalks were used as porous separators (naturally tubular) for air-cathode MFC modules (GC-MFC and MS-MFC, meaning Giant Cane and Maize Stalk, respectively), with carbon cloth-based electrodes. The MFCs were operated across 100Â Î© external load, enriching swine-farming wastewater with addition of sodium acetate (3Â gÂ Lâˆ’1). Initially, these systems showed relatively high internal resistances (especially GC, with R int =Â 5600Â Î©), before the material was completely imbibed by the anolyte. After 10â€“20 days acclimation, despite sufficient electrolytic conductivity was established in both systems (internal resistance around 60â€“90Â Î©), relatively low power densities (around 40Â mWÂ mâˆ’2, normalized by cathode's surface projection) were achieved, if compared to state-of-the-art MFCs, oriented to electricity harvesting. However, the generated electric field was enough to sustain electro-osmotic ions mobility and to establish high pH conditions (pH 11â€“12) at the cathode. Over 70 days of operation, electro-migration and deposition phenomena of valuable elements (Na, Ca, Mg, Mn, K, etc.) were observed, both inside the separator and on the cathode surface. Simultaneously, partial biodegradation of the ligno-cellulosic biomass, especially for MS, drove partial release of organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and other elements in the anodic chamber. These relevant phenomena have to be taken into account in view of possible applications of ligno-cellulosic materials in MFC-driven nutrients recovery from wastewater.",
        "Current wastewater treatment biomeasures are dominated by single microbial species, which can only decolorize low concentrations (â‰¤150Â mgÂ Lâˆ’1) of crystal violet (CV). Considering the advantages of microbial aggregates, with micro-porous structure and complete hierarchical trophic communities, several innovative bioreactors based on periphyton (i.e. epiphyton, metaphyton and epilithon) were examined. The results showed that periphyton could tolerate high concentration of CV (1000Â mgÂ Lâˆ’1) and the immobilized periphyton bioreactors could completely decolorize up to 1000Â mgÂ Lâˆ’1 of CV within 168Â h showing 50â€“100% removal by bioreactors. The removal of CV was a synergistic process accomplished by adsorption (with insignificant desorption) followed by the dominant mechanism of biodegradation. The CV was converted into non-toxic aliphatic compounds in the presence of periphyton. Phytotoxicity and microbial toxicity tests showed that biodegradation of CV did not produce any toxic secondary metabolite, leading to environmentally benign effluents meeting the standards of agricultural irrigation. These results provide an insight into the processes involved in removing CV by periphyton or similar microbial aggregates, and indicate the potential of periphyton as a green material to purify water contaminated by high concentrations of CV.

        "Present work is an effort to study the performance of a PV panel integrated solar still to generate power and to do desalination process to meet the water and power scarcity issues. The system performance is experimentally investigated from different aspects such as still productivity, still efficiency, PV panel power production, PV panel efficiency, and exergy efficiency. Results show that the maximum distillate output of 7.3Â kg was obtained when inclined solar panel basin solar still with the sidewall and bottom insulation. The freshwater production from inclined solar panel basin solar still with the sidewall and bottom insulation, inclined solar panel basin solar still with Sidewall insulation and inclined solar panel basin solar still without any insulation was 7.3Â kg, 4.4Â kg and 3.7Â kg respectively. The daily energy efficiency and exergy efficiency of inclined solar panel basin solar still with the sidewall and bottom insulation are higher compared to other cases. The daily efficiency of 34.5%, 38.3% and 71.2% and exergy efficiency of 1.3%, 2.3% and 4.5% was recorded for inclined solar panel basin solar still without any insulation, inclined solar panel basin solar still with the sidewall insulation and inclined solar panel basin solar still with sidewall and bottom insulation respectively.",
        "Spills due to the floating oil on the surface of sea water shows a significant alteration in the natural phenomenon of the marine ecosystem. Hence, amphiphilic sodium salt of oleoyl carboxymethyl chitosan (NaO-CMCS) was synthesized, characterized and studied as a sustainable adsorbent for the removal of floating oil in the oil spill treatment. Successful chemical modification of chitosan was confirmed by chemical analysis using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Elemental Analyzer. The effect of pH and salinity on the surface charge of NaO-CMCS was studied. Marine diesel was chosen as an oil phase for the emulsion studies. Hydrophobically modified NaO-CMCS shows the oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion stability for more than 6 weeks with droplet size â‰¤ 30 Î¼m which increases with decreasing temperature. The behavior of emulsion with different salinity shows phase separation at pH 5, bridging flocculation at pH 6â€“7 and o/w emulsion at pH 8. Calcium ions act as a cross-linker between two carboxylic acid groups of NaO-CMCS, enhancing the removal of oil from the creamy emulsion. The recovery of oil was 75â€“85% and 19â€“49% from deionized water and sea water, respectively. Oil was not chemically altered during the recovery, demonstrating the effectiveness of this derivative in the oil spill response for the removal and recovery of floating oil from the sea water.",
        "The technical performance, economic cost and environmental impact of six full-scale tertiary coagulation/filtration processes located in Kunming, China were evaluated. All tertiary treatment processes removed total phosphorus (TP) and total suspended solids (TSS) efficiently, with the removal percentages of 55.0%â€“80.0% and 50.0%â€“74.0%, respectively. Polyaluminium chloride (PAC) consumption for TP and TSS removal in the six tertiary treatment processes were quite different, with chemical dosages of 7.9â€“38.5Â g PAC/g TP removed and 0.3â€“1.7Â g PAC/g TSS removed, respectively. The multiple linear regression analysis showed that the PAC dosage closed to the optimal value benefited TP and TSS removal, and this also reduced the economic cost. For environmental impacts, the main source of greenhouse gas was electricity consumption and the coagulation/filtration process had positive effect on reducing eutrophication. The comprehensive assessment including technical, economic and environmental aspects was characterized by the composite cost index. The composite cost index showed that the tertiary treatment process of micro-flocculation with D type/cloth media filtration achieved the best comprehensive performance, while D type filter had great potential for energy saving and chemical reduction.",
        "A submerged membrane photobioreactor was tested to provide a feasible means to conduct tertiary treatment of livestock wastewater. In this study, three phases of a semi-continuous photobioreactor were tested based on hydraulic retention time to evaluate biomass productivity, effluent quality, and fouling characteristics of the membrane module. The results show that the membrane module contributes to securing effluent quality with high nitrogen (36%) and phosphorus (25%) daily removal rates. Shorter hydraulic retention time resulted in better performance for removal of nitrogen and phosphorus; a 3â€¯d hydraulic retention time resulted in 96% (nitrogen), and 85% (phosphorus) removal. Under the proposed condition, the biomass concentration simultaneously increased to 3500â€¯mg/L (dry weight). Active photosynthesis in the photobioreactor was strongly associated with the average concentrations of soluble microbial products (carbohydrate: 84.5â€¯mg/L, protein: 37.9â€¯mg/L) and extracellular polymeric substances (carbohydrate: 44.1â€¯mg/L, protein: 556.9â€¯mg/L). Relatively high carbohydrate concentrations in the permeate provided evidence of a strong relationship between the effluent quality and carbohydrates in the soluble microbial products. Morphological and chemical analyses proved that micro-algal membrane fouling is attributable to soluble microbial products and/or extracellular polymeric substances. These occur in significant amounts after 10â€¯d, indicating an unavoidable need for biomass harvesting. This study provides an understanding of the fouling trend according to varying hydraulic retention time and biomass harvesting, and offers a viable operation strategy for use of a submerged membrane photobioreactor to convert pollutants into useful bioresources and improve effluent quality.",
        "Due to frequent oil spill accidents and the increase of industrial oily wastewater, the removal of oil and organic pollutants from water is highly desired. In this work, a low-cost and durable flexible membrane made of layered double hydroxides nanosheets on cellulose support is successfully fabricated by combining the in situ growth technique and hydrophobic modification. Firstly, the rough surface is fabricated by in situ growth of Zn-Al layered double hydroxide nanosheets. Then, the superhydrophobic surface is obtained by grafting the silane coupling agent. The relevant results revealed that the obtained membrane showed both superhydrophobic and superoleophilic propertied simultaneously. The samples not only show high separation efficiency (all above 94.4%), great chemical durability and good recyclability, but also display excellent separation properties for surfactant-stabilized water-in-oil emulsions with high separation efficiency (less than 25â€¯ppm) and good flux (500 Lmâˆ’2hâˆ’1) without extra energy. Therefore, the superhydrophobic layered double hydroxide/cellulose membranes enable an efficient separation for various oil/water emulsions, showing attractive potential for practical oil/water separation.",
        "Dead-end ultrafiltration (UF) has been considered as a more energy efficient operation mode compared to cross-flow filtration for the production of drinking/potable water in large-scale water treatment systems. Conventional control systems utilize pre-determined set-points for filtration and backwash durations of the constant flux dead-end UF process. Commonly known potential membrane fouling parameters such as feed water solids concentrations and specific cake resistance during filtration were not taken into considerations in the conventional control systems. In this research, artificial neural networks (ANN) predictive model and controllers were utilized for the process control of the UF process. An UF experimental system has been developed to conduct experiments and compare efficiencies of both the conventional set-points and ANN control systems. The novelty of this study is to utilize commonly available on-line and simple laboratory analysis data to estimate potential membrane fouling parameters and subsequently utilize the ANN control system to reduce water losses. Reduction of water losses were achieved by prolonging filtration duration for feed water with low turbidity using the ANN control system. This advanced control system would be of interest to operators of industrial-scale UF membrane water treatment plants for the reduction of water losses with existing facilities.",
        "Zero Liquid Discharge refers to the elimination of wastewater discharge from a process. Many Zero Liquid Discharge systems are designed to meet the increasingly stringent environmental regulations and enable water recovery. Generally speaking, a Zero Liquid Discharge process must be capable of minimizing produced wastewater volumes, by employing effective water treatment options. It is often crucial to ensure that effective combinations of treatment technologies are used to assemble a Zero Liquid Discharge system, in an economically feasible manner. Even though various recommendations for enhancing treatment systems involve minimizing wastewater generation, which would reduce the volume of wastewater treated all the way to Zero Liquid Discharge, it is often costly to retrofit existing wastewater generating systems, especially if large brine flowrates are involved. As a result, numerous brine-generating processes (such as desalination plants, textile plants etc.) employ end-of-pipe Zero Liquid Discharge systems, to meet strict environmental discharge standards. This paper aims to identify effective design strategies for End-of-Pipe Zero Liquid Discharge systems, by proposing an optimization approach that allows the screening through various treatment and Zero Liquid Discharge technologies, so as to assemble cost-effective Zero Liquid Discharge strategies and enable suitable water recovery options. The proposed model has been illustrated using a case study that demonstrates how the generated Zero Liquid Discharge scheme changes by varying the End-of-Pipe discharge requirements."
        "Advanced Oxidation Processes (O3- and H2O2- assisted photocatalysis under Vis irradiation) were applied for the removal of recalcitrant pollutant from wastewater. The new periodically patterned carbon nanotube entitled cheetah skin structure introduced for the first time. The photocatalytic activity of cheetah skin CNT modified by poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was tested in the decomposition of bisphenol A (BPA). The obtained CNT/PAN/PMMA composites differ in morphological structure. In PAN/CNT composite, a tubular coating was formed and a continuous coating layer of PAN on the surface of nanotubes was observed. In PAN/PMMA/CNT composite after carbonization process, the PMMA was completely evaporated and Carbon Nano Particles (CNP) with circular morphology in order of less than 10â€¯nm were coated on the surface of nanotube walls forming a cheetah skin structure. The presence of CNP led to significant increase in degradation temperature. The application of tested nanocomposites enabled a significant removal of BPA. The highest changes in water pollution were observed during first 20â€¯min of treatment. Nanocomposite containing 1.5% PAN - 0.5%PMMA demonstrated the best activity. During photo enhanced ozonation almost 90â€“95% of BPA was removed. H2O2 slightly increased oxidation under Vis irradiation. The removal of BPA proceeded according to a pseudo-first order regime. Toxicity of BPA was significantly reduced after treatment and applied procedures enabled to obtain high quality non-toxic water. The obtained results clearly indicate that novel PAN-PMMA modified CNT could be a promising candidate for the photo mineralization of BPA.",
        "Water scarcity is a serious issue facing our planet right along -side with climate change. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impacts associated with the use of water by the oil palm trees and the industry for the production of crude palm oil in Malaysia; evaluate the uncertainties of the outcome of a study based on pathway assumptions and the choice of allocation. A full life cycle assessment and a stand-alone water footprint value based on the local water stress index has been determined. The system boundary included the oil palm nursery, plantation (with land use change of oil palm to oil palm and from logged over forest) and palm oil mill (biogas capture scenario). The results showed that the direct water used by the crops and process was minimal because the oil palm plantations in Malaysia were firstly rain fed and not irrigated and secondly Malaysia is located in a region with high availability of renewable water resulting to a low water stress index. The water footprint concluded that the main potential impacts within the system boundary were dominated by land conversion, production and use of fertilisers and pesticides. These findings contradict the general perception of any agriculture system where the notion to assume that the water used by the crop will have the major potential impact. The findings also highlighted the importance of the choice of pathway, government initiatives and managerial intervention for biogas capture which resulted to a 117% reduction in the water footprint. Economic allocation had a 21% increase in the water footprint as compared to weight allocation. It was recommended that plantations implement Good Agricultural Practices that addresses the key elements of land, water management, fertiliser and integrated pest management and the choice of pathways and allocation procedures are made transparent with the results as outcomes may differ as shown in this paper.

        "A microbial fuel cell (MFC), as a cleaner wastewater treatment process, can recover electricity from organic wastes. However, high power production and high quality effluent are difficult to achieve simultaneously. In this study, a novel filtration composite anode (FCA), which combined carbon fiber brush and carbon textile was proposed to enhance COD removal and power generation performance of MFCs. The COD removal rate constant of MFCs with the filtration composite anode (FCA-MFC) was 0.33 hâˆ’1, much higher than that of MFCs with single brush anode (FB-MFC) (0.23 hâˆ’1) or textile anode (FT-MFC) (0.18 hâˆ’1) in the recirculation mode, and also exceeded that of CA-MFC in non-recirculation mode (0.12 hâˆ’1). FCA-MFC delivered a maximum power density of 1140â€¯mWâ€¯mâˆ’2 at a recirculation rate of 2â€¯mLâ€¯minâˆ’1, which was higher than the FB-MFC (990â€¯mWâ€¯mâˆ’2) and the FT-MFC (80â€¯mWâ€¯mâˆ’2) and its counterparts in non-recirculation mode (1000â€¯mWâ€¯mâˆ’2). Moreover, the FCA-MFC maintained a higher current density (4.0 A mâˆ’2) than the other two MFCs until the COD decreased to 40â€¯mgâ€¯Lâˆ’1 at an external resistance of 100â€¯Î©. CV and EIS tests verified a higher electrochemical performance of the filtration composite anode. These results demonstrated higher COD removals and power generation of the composite anode at ambient temperature, resulting from the filtration effect that facilitated mass transfer, increased microbial colonization, and improved electrochemical activity. Considering the high-quality effluent and high power generation, the filtration composite anode configuration promises a great potential for sustainable wastewater treatment application.",
        "In situ bioremediation has been applied to remediate trichloroethylene (TCE)-contaminated groundwater, and primary substrates need to be supplied to enhance the reductive dechlorination. Gamma poly-glutamic acid (Î³-PGA) is a natural occurring and biodegradable biopolymer, which consists of glutamic acid monomers crosslinked between Î³-carboxyl and Î±-amino functional groups. Microcosm experiments were performed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of TCE dechlorination using Î³-PGA as the primary substrate. The dominant dechlorinating bacteria and bacterial communities were determined using nucleotide sequence analyses and 16S rRNA-based denatured-gradient-gel electrophoresis profiling. The variations in Dehalococcoides spp. (DHC) were evaluated using the real-time polymerase chain reaction technique. Results show that Î³-PGA supplement created anaerobic conditions and resulted in significant increase of total organic carbon [1930â€¯mg/L (1â€¯mL Î³-PGA in 30â€¯mL groundwater)]. About 99% of TCE (initial concentrationâ€¯=â€¯4.3â€¯mg/L) was degraded after 85 days and acidification was not observed because the released amine from Î³-PGA could react with water and form ammonia, which resulted in alkaline conditions due to its basic characteristic. Solution pH was maintained neutral and benefited the growth of DHC. The supplement of Î³-PGA enhanced the growth of DHC from 1.03â€¯Ã—â€¯104 to 2.6â€¯Ã—â€¯106 gene copies/g soil, and the TCE dechlorination rate was enhanced. The increase in ethene concentrations indicated the complete TCE dechlorination with Î³-PGA addition. Î³-PGA globule (with a zeta potential ofÂ âˆ’19.8 mv) had three major diameters in micro to nano-scale ranges. This allowed Î³-PGA to migrate into different soil formations and distribute within soil pores evenly. Results suggest that Î³-PGA can be used as the carbon substrate to enhance the efficiency of reductive dechlorination of chlorinated compounds.",
        "Knowledge of water resource consumption and pollution during the life cycle of energy production and developing energy industry in regions with abundant water resources are two ways to improve water efficiency. In this study, a water footprint model for energy sources was developed, and water footprint inventories of the primary fossil fuels (e.g., coal, crude oil, natural gas) and power sources (e.g., thermal, nuclear, wind, solar photovoltaic, and hydropower) in China were compiled. The water footprints calculated for coal, crude oil, and natural gas were 0.14Â m3/GJ, 0.29Â m3/GJ, and 0.11Â m3/GJ, respectively. The water footprints of power sources increased as follows: wind (0.14Â m3/GJ), nuclear (0.19Â m3/GJ), thermal (1.19Â m3/GJ), solar (5.3Â m3/GJ), and hydropower (6.75Â m3/GJ). From a life cycle perspective, the water footprints of the three primary energy sources mainly originated from the extraction stages. The water footprint from upstream stages accounted for the highest proportion of the total water footprint of nuclear, wind, and solar power. Regional analyses revealed that provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan etc. have appropriate water resources and capacity for future development of energy system. A water footprint inventory of primary energy could provide basic data for water footprint analyses of secondary energy, materials, and products downstream across multiple sectors and could support water management in the energy industry.",
        "This study examines a hybrid system (HS) that combines a greywater reclamation system with the centralized water system. Greywater is collected from laundry, showers, faucets and dishwashing and is reclaimed for non-potable on-site purposes (i.e., irrigation and toilet flushing) by using submerged membrane bioreactors (MBRs). This technology can reduce the burden of the conventional system (CS), defined as the water supply and wastewater treatment systems within the City of Atlanta. We conducted a life cycle assessment (LCA) comparison of the HS and CS using TRACI v2.1, which simulates ten impacts related to the ecosystem, human health and natural resources. We simulated the technology feasibility for nine residential zones, including five single-family house zones (SFZs) and four multi-family apartment building zones (MFZs) that vary by land use and population density (0.4â€“62.2 persons per 1000Â m2). The greywater reclamation system reduces non-potable water demand in SFZs (by 17â€“49%) and MFZs (by 6â€“32%) while simultaneously reducing electricity consumption by 17â€“49% and 32â€“41% for SFZs and MFZs, respectively. Moreover, the LCA score of the CS is 20â€“41% lower than that of the HS. However, the sensitivity analysis indicates that energy sources in electricity generation play a critical role in reducing and stabilizing life cycle impacts. The results indicate that the LCA scores stabilize at higher population densities. Therefore, once the greywater reclamation capacity is exhausted, municipalities can further decrease the life cycle impacts related to water infrastructure through improvements in the electricity generation infrastructure.",
        "The chrome plating industry originates wastewater containing hazardous pollutants as hexavalent chromium. In this work, two alternatives for the treatment of the wastewater streams generated in a Spanish chrome-plating plant are studied from environmental and techno-economic perspectives. Both scenarios include the operations needed to obtain a chromate material and the further treatment of the produced wastewater. In the base scenario, the wastewater rich in Cr(VI) is treated through a sequential reduction â€“ precipitation - settling process. In the alternative scenario the treatment of the wastewater consists of ionic exchange and photocatalytic process, which allows reducing Cr(VI) content by the use of solar light. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was applied to both scenarios in order to determine the most important impacts. For that purpose, data provided by a chrome-plating plant, experimental data obtained in the laboratory and results of process simulation were used to build up the inventory data. Obtained results show that the main impact in the base scenario is the disposal of the solid sludge, obtained as waste, due to intensive energy consumption. Regarding the alternative scenario, the use of chemicals is the main contributor to environmental impacts. By comparing both scenarios, the alternative one presents a clear improvement of the environmental performance, reducing about 85% the environmental damage. Finally, techno-economic evaluation results reveal that the cost of the alternative process per unit of treated water is about 15% higher than in the case of the conventional treatment.",
        "Nanoscale zero valent iron/Cu was prepared by green synthesis method and was used to remediate Cr(VI) contaminated groundwater. Nanoscale zero valent iron/Cu was characterized by scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Transmission electron microscope and X-ray diffraction. Batch experiments were performed to investigate optimum condition for removal of hexavalent chromium(Cr(VI)) from groundwater by nanoscale zero valent iron/Cu. With the decrease of pH value, the decrease of the initial concentration of Cr(VI) and the increase of temperature, the removal efficiency of Cr(VI) increases. The presence of humic acids in groundwater can inhibited the activity of nanoscale zero valent iron/Cu. The removal efficiency of Cr(VI) reached 94.7% under the condition of pH of 5 and temperature of 303Â K. The removal of Cr(VI) by nanoscale zero valent iron/Cu was well fitted with Langmuir-Hinshelwood first reaction kinetic model, with apparent rate constant K obs values estimated at 0.07430, 0.09650, 0.1183 and 0.1473Â minâˆ’1Â at 298, 303, 308 and 313Â K. Overall, nanoscale zero valent iron/Cu is a promising green material to remove Cr(VI) from polluted groundwater.",
        "A robust ion-exchange resin wafer electrodeionization technology was used to demonstrate the energy efficiency of impaired water desalination. The loose ion exchange resin beads used in conventional electrodeionization were immobilized and molded to form a porous resin wafer material. In this study, the energy efficiency of brackish water desalination using resin wafer electrodeionization was evaluated along with salt removal ratio, current efficiency and productivity. Several key operating factors, including treatment time, applied electrical energy and feed flow rate were selected through experimental design. In addition, the removal rate constant in resin wafer electrodeionization was determined via a pseudo first-order kinetic model, and then correlated with operation parameters. Furthermore, the prediction models of the productivity and energy consumption were established using response surface methodology. Results suggest that resin wafer electrodeionization can improve energy efficiency to greater than 35% in comparison to reverse osmosis (normally âˆ¼12%) for impaired water desalination. The energy consumption of resin wafer electrodeionization was found to be 0.35â€“0.66 kWh/m3 with productivity of 20.1â€“44.7 L/hr/m2 (i.e., 5.3â€“11.8 gal/hr/m2) for brackish water desalination. Furthermore, a preliminary economic evaluation on impaired water desalination using resin wafer electrodeionization comparable to commercial reverse osmosis process was provided. It suggests that resin wafer electrodeionization offers the potential for an abundant source of fresh water from impaired water desalination at a cost-effective manner, which should be viewed as a crucial component in the portfolio of water supply options.",
        "Three acclimated anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactors filled to 40% by volume with cubic AC920 media (protected surface area of 680Â m2Â mâˆ’3) were studied to treat brewery wastewater at hydraulic retention times of 6â€“24Â h and mesophilic condition (35.0Â Â±Â 0.1Â Â°C). The reactors were seeded with media that had developed mature anaerobic biofilm prior to the start of this study. Soluble chemical oxygen demand of the brewery wastewater was equal to 4.0Â Â±Â 1Â kgÂ mâˆ’3, total chemical oxygen demand 5.2Â Â±Â 2.1Â kg-COD mâˆ’3, and the ratio of 5-day biological oxygen demand to chemical oxygen demand was equal to 0.77Â Â±Â 0.02. Dissolved oxygen concentration in the influent wastewater was below detection limit (0.1Â mg-O2 Lâˆ’1). This study focused on the assessment of optimal design surface area loading rates for an anaerobic moving bed biofilm process by varying the hydraulic retention times from 6 to 24Â h. Volumetric removal rates of 3.0Â Â±Â 0.2, 4.2Â Â±Â 0.3, 7.2Â Â±Â 0.6, 12.4Â Â±Â 0.8, 13.4Â Â±Â 1.0, and 12.0Â Â±Â 1.1 g-sCOD dâˆ’ 1 were achieved at 24, 18, 12, 10, 8, and 6Â h hydraulic retention times. Hydraulic retention time of 18Â h exhibited the highest chemical oxygen demand removal, at 88Â Â±Â 2.5%, and the highest carbon conversion into methane at 0.34Â Â±Â 0.06Â m3-CH4 kg-sCODâˆ’1. At this hydraulic retention time the specific surface area activity was 13Â Â±Â 1Â g-sCOD mâˆ’2dâˆ’1, considering that the organic loading rate was 4.0Â Â±Â 0.3Â kg-sCOD mâˆ’3dâˆ’1. Biogas composition was 71Â Â±Â 2% methane and 26Â Â±Â 4% carbon dioxide. Media clogging and mass transfer limitations due to overgrowing biomass in the interior media channels was observed at surface area loading rates above 54Â g-sCOD mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1. However, kinetic tests revealed that mass transfer limitation started at surface area loading rate of 44Â g-sCOD mâˆ’2dâˆ’1. Anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactor has been shown to be a reliable treatment option for high-strength wastewaters and could be used in brewery wastewater management as a resource to comply with the discharge limit regulation.",
        "Capacitive deionization (CDI) has been considered as a low energy consumption, economically attractive and environmental friendly method for desalination of salt water. Generally, the electrode materials play the key role in CDI. In the present work, representative activated carbons (ACs) recycled from bitter-tea and palm shell wastes (denoting BAC and PAC, respectively) were used as the CDI electrodes. To provide additional disinfection ability during CDI of salt water, Ag@C core-shell nanoparticles prepared from carbonization of Ag+-cyclodextrin complexes at 673Â K were dispersed on the AC electrodes. By FTIR, it seems that the ACs have the less oxygen on their surfaces with more aromatic contents if the compared with the shell wastes as the carbon sources. Electrosorption efficiencies during the one-through CDI of a salt water ([NaCl]Â =Â 1000Â ppm) using the BAC and PAC electrodes atÂ +1.2Â V are 25 and 28%, respectively. As the voltage is increased toÂ +1.6Â V, the electrosorption efficiencies and recovery performances of the PAC and Ag@C/PAC electrodes during the repeated CDI tests (+1.6Â V â†’ 0Â V â†’Â +1.6Â V) are similar to those operated at 1.2Â V. However, after the potential polarity is reversed (+1.6Â V toÂ âˆ’1.6Â V), their electrosorption efficiencies are considerably increased (capable of 40%). The ACs dispersed with the Ag@C nanoparticles (Ag@C/AC) has less contact angles, giving a better hydrophilicity. High disinfection abilities (95â€“98%) for the Ag@C/ACs electrodes during the 2-h CDI reaction can be obtained. This work exemplifies that the ACs recycled from shell wastes as CDI electrodes for desalination of salt water are chemically feasible. In addition, the AC-based CDI electrodes dispersed with Ag@C core-shell nanoparticles have additional disinfection ability during desalination of salt water.",
        "Decentralized rainwater harvesting (RWH) from roof runoff can complement the centralized supply of mains (drinking) water for a range of contexts, to assist in alleviating issues of water security. However, treatment to potable standard of harvested rainwater is not widespread. Consequently a comparative life cycle analysis (LCA) of decentralized and centralized potable water supply has not previously been undertaken. In this paper we describe a novel point-of-use (POU) treatment device, which was used to treat harvested rainwater to potable standard. We then provide a performance assessment for this system and an LCA with a comparison to centralized supply. Results of the performance assessment indicate a water saving efficiency (ET) of between 0.6 and 100%, depending on rainfall (0.6 from April when rainfall was significantly below average). This highlights that the POU device was able to deal with the scale of roof runoff supply originating from a RWH system at a commercial building scale. The LCA results suggest that potable water produced from this decentralized RWH POU system currently performs more poorly than centralized water from an environmental perspective. Its impacts in most categories would be significantly reduced if the electricity consumed by the system were supplied from a renewable source such as solar PV or wind turbines instead of the UK grid. Priority should be given to optimizing the energy efficiency and exploring opportunities for combined use with renewable energy technologies in order to improve the environmental performance of POU treatment devices.",
        "Magnetic attapulgite/carbon supported NiFe layered double hydroxides (APT/C@NiFe-LDHs) were fabricated based on the spent bleaching earth via a facile and green hydrothermal approach. Multiple characterizations were conducted to illustrate that NiFe-LDHs was successfully anchored on the surface of APT during the preparation process. The magnetic response and adsorption properties of as-prepared composites could be facilely controlled by varying the Ni/Fe molar ratio. As expected, the coating of NiFe-LDHs significantly increased the adsorption ability to pollutants, the resultant composites prepared at the Ni/Fe molar ratio of 1:1 exhibited excellent adsorption capacities for methylene blue, Pb(II), and chlortetracycline hydrochloride of 271.28, 180.90, and 308.21Â mg/g, respectively. The high adsorption capacity of the obtained adsorbents could be ascribed to the synergetic effect of the carbon species and NiFe-LDHs. In addition, the adsorbent could be easily separated by magnetic separation technology, and exhibited a stable recyclability after six adsorption-desorption cycles. This work provided a feasible pathway to design and fabricate adsorption materials for wastewater treatment taken into account both high-performance adsorption and cost-effective way. "

        "As a result of an increased global demand on metals and minerals a number of new metal mines have been launched into operation around the world. In Finland, the reviving mining industry has faced public criticism regarding its social licence to operate. A central theme in this criticism is a concern for water management and the release of effluents into the environment. This article reviews the environmental and social performance of the Finnish mining sector in water related issues. Main challenges are in water use and water quality and finding alternative solutions based on technologies, environmental indicators, and different means of communication.",
        "Most major mining companies have articulated strategies and targets to minimise the impacts of operations on surface and groundwater resources. However, the focus tends to be on mitigating negative impacts. In this field note, we make two contributions to assist mining sites in playing a positive role in implementing Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) aspirations. First, we introduce the notion of â€œwater benefitsâ€ as a pathway for operationalizing regional IWRM objectives at a mine site level. Second, we propose a decision making framework to facilitate investment in water benefits. The framework comprises of five steps: (1) Select system boundary wherein benefits are to be delivered; (2) Quantify water availability; (3) Determine potential benefits; (4) Identify acceptable benefits; and (5) Implementation and monitoring. For a site to deliver water benefits that extend beyond the legal obligation of the company, we contend that there must be a sound business case. We therefore distinguish between steps that should be decided by the business (steps 1, 2 and 4) from those that should be completed in collaboration with the broader community (steps 3 and 5). Within this field note we do not test the practical utility of the framework in an empirical setting and as such it is not intended to be prescriptive. Rather, we seek to provide a foundation for scholarly/industry debate about how decision makers at a mine site level could take a more active role in contributing towards IWRM aspirations. We conclude that a â€œwater benefitsâ€ perspective offers a novel basis for establishing regional water targets and could serve numerous advantages at a site-level including improved recognition about the value of water and improved understanding and mitigation of strategic water-related risks.",
        "Energy production from unconventional natural gas resources, such as coalbed methane, has the potential to generate significant water quantities for use in water-stressed areas to augment existing water supplies. Coalbed methane (CBM) produced water is generated from shallower formations than traditional oil and gas resources where water quality may be influenced by fresh water supplies in the area. Variability in produced water quality between wells and across geologic basins must be characterized in order to categorize water types appropriate for beneficial use. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to a composite geochemical database to identify indicators of variability in water composition and quality. Component analysis revealed that water quality indicators of variability were related to: (i) aquifer recharge that dilutes constituent concentrations (37%), (ii) dissolution of soluble aquifer minerals such as sodium and exchange of calcium and magnesium (13.8%), and (iii) coal depositional environment influence on chloride and trace metal fractions (14% of variability). Ternary relationships between Naâ€“Clâ€“HCO3 and Naâ€“Caâ€“Mg correlate to marine influence in the coal depositional environment and well proximity to recharge, respectively. Relationships identified in this study highlight water quality compositions with opportunities for beneficial use.",
        "Aiming at tracing the sources of anthropogenic phosphorus flowing into watercourses, this study develops a static model for analyzing the phosphorus flows within a socioeconomic ecosystem. This model consists of four major subsystems: phosphorus ore mining/processing, phosphorous-containing product manufacturing, phosphorus-containing product use and phosphorus-containing waste/wastewater management. Furthermore, based on the principle of mass balance, we provided formulas for calculating phosphorus flows of the ecosystem. Then, we quantified the anthropogenic phosphorus flows using the bottomâ€“up approach for the Chaohu watershed in 2008. The data and parameters are mainly obtained from field surveys, the literature, industrial experts, and official statistics. The results show that approximately 36 thousand tons of phosphorous flowed into watercourses in the Chaohu watershed in 2008, of which 99% came from phosphorus-containing product use (55% from crop farming, 34% from large-scale breeding, 7% from rural consumption, 2% from urban consumption, and 1% from domestic breeding). Therefore, we provided suggestions on mitigating phosphorus loss into watercourses. The study provides a method (model and the calculation formulas) to quantify anthropogenic phosphorus flows at a watershed level, which helps to understand the relationship between human activities and eutrophication.",
        "Communicating the mining industry's water use is fundamental to maintaining its social license to operate but the majority of corporate reporting schemes list indicators. The Minerals Council of Australia's Water Accounting Framework was designed to assist the minerals industry obtain consistency in its accounting method and in the definitions of terms used in water reporting. The significance of this paper is that it shows that the framework has been designed to be sufficiently robust to describe any mining/mineral related operation. The Water Accounting Framework was applied across four operations over three countries producing four commodities. The advantages of the framework were then evident through the presentation of the reports. The contextual statement of the framework was able to explain contrasting reuse efficiencies. The Inputâ€“Output statements showed that evaporation was a significant loss for most of the operations in the study which highlights a weakness of reporting schemes that focus on discharge volumes. The framework method promotes data reconciliation which proved the presence of flows that two operations in the study had neglected to provide. Whilst there are many advantages of the framework, the major points are that the reporting statements of the framework, when presented together, can better enable the public to understand water interactions at a site-level and allows for valid comparisons between sites, regardless of locale and commodity. With mining being a global industry, these advantages are best realised if there was international adoption of the framework.",
        "Modern long distance ore pipeline systems are subject to strong costs, both from the economic and environmental standpoints. The task of assessing the relative importance of energy and water consumption without a detailed engineering analysis is often not obvious. In the present paper, the relative importance of water and energy unit costs is assessed by a novel dimensionless formulation accounting for the essential hydraulic and cost elements that conform the slurry transport. It is found that, for conditions resembling those of copper and iron concentrate pipelines, the ratio between energy and water costs has a wide range, depending on the particular transport conditions and unit cost scenarios. Although operating at similar volume fractions, results indicate that energy/water cost relations may differ between copper and iron concentrate pipelines and local conditions, thus suggesting the need to explicitly include energy and water cost in the design strategy.",
        "This study explores the extent and quality of localised mining water-related disclosures from the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW). The data set provides an atypical opportunity to study voluntary and mandatory environmental reporting, as mining companies often produce their own voluntary sustainability reports, yet some mandatory reporting is also required due to NSW development consent conditions. In order to assess the extensiveness of mandatory reporting, development consent reporting requirements are compared to a selection of voluntary water reporting indicators. Most indicators were taken from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and Water Accounting Framework for the Minerals Industry (WAFMI), but the authors also included additional indicators derived from community water-related discussions. It is found that most of the information required by the indicators is also required by the consent conditions. In particular, information relevant to four GRI indicators is reported within either annual reviews or environmental management plans. Consent conditions are discretionary, however, and older consent conditions may not require such reports to be made publicly available through the internet. Additionally, a content analysis is conducted of available mandatory and voluntary reports from four mining operations. The voluntary reports were found to provide site-level information that was either as good as that found within the annual reviews, or of lesser quality, but in no instance better. Further, no voluntary report stated definitively whether operations impacted on water sources. Nor was there any reporting on water storage capacity or the quality of water after recycling or reuse. Finally, Dryzek's â€˜discursive democracyâ€™ theoretical framework on the quality of a deliberation system is used to analyse the extent to which NSW legal and administrative processes are designed to facilitate deliberation by catchment residents. Theoretically, the system is well designed, as important information is made publicly available and community consultation is a mandatory part of the process. However, the system is not without flaws and could be improved by providing better access to information.",
        "Contaminated land remediation has traditionally been viewed as sustainable practice because it reduces urban sprawl and mitigates risks to human being and the environment. However, in an emerging green and sustainable remediation (GSR) movement, remediation practitioners have increasingly recognized that remediation operations have their own environmental footprint. The GSR calls for sustainable behaviour in the remediation industry, for which a series of white papers and guidance documents have been published by various government agencies and professional organizations. However, the relationship between the adoption of such sustainable behaviour and its underlying driving forces has not been studied. This study aims to contribute to sustainability science by rendering a better understanding of what drives organizational behaviour in adopting sustainable practices. Factor analysis (FA) and structural equation modelling (SEM) were used to investigate the relationship between sustainable practices and key factors driving these behaviour changes in the remediation field. A conceptual model on sustainability in the environmental remediation industry was developed on the basis of stakeholder and institutional theories. The FA classified sustainability considerations, institutional promoting and impeding forces, and stakeholder's influence. Subsequently the SEM showed that institutional promoting forces had significant positive effects on adopting sustainability measures, and institutional impeding forces had significant negative effects. Stakeholder influences were found to have only marginal direct effect on the adoption of sustainability; however, they exert significant influence on institutional promoting forces, thus rendering high total effect (i.e. direct effect plus indirect effect) on the adoption of sustainability. This study suggests that sustainable remediation represents an advanced sustainable practice, which may only be fully endorsed by both internal and external stakeholders after its regulatory, normative and cognitive components are institutionalized.

        "Reducing water consumption and increasing energy efficiency are emerging as two key requirements to move towards a more sustainable mining industry. However, the two targets can be in conflict as water management initiatives often lead to an increase in energy consumption. On the other hand, some water initiatives may lead to reduction in energy consumption, leading to synergy between energy and water efficiency initiatives. To maximise energy and water sustainability in mine water management, it is essential that synergy and trade-off potentials between the water and energy targets related to water initiatives are recognised. Limited research has been conducted to develop a tool or approach to consider water and energy impacts of water initiatives in a coupled manner. This paper presents a protocol to recognise water-energy synergy and trade-off potentials. The protocol is demonstrated for three case study mine sites. The results of this paper show that a particular water management option can hold a synergy potential for one mine but a trade-off potential for another mine. The rigour of the approach captures cases where water management options are predicted to be synergistic, but are in fact shown to be a trade-off according to the results. It is concluded that the use of this protocol can provide insights about synergy and trade-off potentials between water and energy targets of mine sites subject to water management options. This is an innovative approach to more holistically assess water management option impacts.",
        "Rational use of water can be a powerful tool to promote sustainability on university campuses. Other than resource and financial savings, it aims to support technological and behavior innovation towards a more balanced relationship between human activities and nature. This work reports on a water saving program case study, led by a research group at a university in the northeast of Brazil. It describes and discusses methods used and results obtained. From 1999 to 2008 the program reduced per capita water use by half at the university. It has brought significant resource savings to the institution. Internal results foster the implementation of cooperative projects between the university and public and private partners. All these projects involve engineers, social workers and undergraduate students from different courses. However, internal and external results have been insufficient to guarantee the internalization of the program in routine activities of the university. The permanence of the program still depends on the research group that created and manages it. The paper also presents the difficulties faced in sustaining a program like this at a Brazilian university and discusses future action to be taken to achieve the program's goals.",
        "Water is required for mining and mineral processing operations. In recent years, the mining industry is facing increasing water demand and increasing competition with other water users. Hence, mine water systems need to be well managed to ensure water is reliably available for mining operations. Energy is required for almost all water processes, such as pumping, treatment, cooling and heating. The management of a mine water system is related to energy use. For strategic mine water management, information about the energy demand directly related to different water management options is usually required to assist in the decision-making process of selecting suitable water management options. This research presents the application of an exergy analysis technique named â€˜Physical Hydronomicsâ€™ to show critical factors affecting the energy demand of water management options. The analysis identifies focus points where additional energy demand can be reduced or avoided when upgrading a water system. At the same time, energy demand of different water options isalso quantified. The method is demonstrated by assessing the energy demand of three water desalination options of a coal mine. The aim of introducing these water options to the mine is to improve water use efficiency. The exergy analysis technique generates exergy profiles of water flows and presents critical factors related to the energy demand of water flows. At the end of the analysis, total exergy demand of each of the three water desalination options is estimated.",
        "Lime drying is an effective technique to achieve the volume reduction of sewage sludge produced by wastewater treatment plants. It holds the advantages featuring most cost-effective, practical operation with high dryness fraction and good stability. However, the great challenge facing environmental engineering is to solve the outlet for lime-dried sludge (LDS). Since calcium in LDS is a potential raw material for producing cement, the feasibility of combining LDS disposal with cement kiln and the influence on sintering of cement were investigated in this work. The results indicated that adding LDS (<15Â wt %) improved the burnability of clinker leading to reduce the temperatures for calcium carbonate (CaCO3) decomposition and liquid phase formation. Furthermore, the presence of phosphorus and other trace elements increased the amount of liquid phase and decreased the viscosity, making it favorable for forming tricalcium silicate (C3S) in cement clinker. The free lime content in the clinkers was below 1.0%; thus, meeting the standard of Chinese current regulatory thresholds of 1.5%. Compressive strength of the clinkers produced with different amount of sludge at 3, 7, and 28Â d met cement production standards (GB/T17671â€“1999). Moreover, when LDS was substituted, it not only provided chemical components but also contributed 2441Â J/g of LDS with moisture content less than 50% in cement producing kilns. Overall, this work could effectively achieve the sludge treatment target of environmental protection, solid reduction, and resources utilization.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to provide Characterization Factors (CFs) for the toxicity related impact categories in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs). The CFs already available were updated whereas others were implemented for the first time by means of USEtox and USES-LCA 2.0 methodologies. The list of PPCPs includes human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity for both models whereas terrestrial and marine ecotoxicity were assessed with USES-LCA 2.0. Moreover, all the available emission compartments were considered for the calculation. The resulting CFs were subjected to a sensitivity analysis and results determined that human toxicological and ecotoxicological effects (ED50 and avlogEC50, respectively) as well as degradation rate in water were the most sensitive parameters. The calculated CFs were used in the environmental assessment of a Completely Autotrophic Nitrogen removal Over Nitrite (CANON) pilot plant. PPCPs were found to have a major impact on freshwater ecotoxicity, accounting for 81% or 97% of the total impact with USES-LCA 2.0 and USEtox, respectively. Moreover, a more precise determination of human toxicity was obtained after updating CFs values calculated with USEtox, with contributions up to 50% of the total impact. Therefore, the provision of new and updated CFs allows a more accurate environmental assessment of processes where PPCPs are present.",
        "This study analyzes the viability of using sewage sludge ash (SSA) as a raw material in the composition of concrete, with a similar dosage to when it is used to manufacture blocks, therefore, with dry consistency given the type of the industrial process of these precast. These ashes are a serious problem, so their valorization in a sector like construction, with a high demand of resources, would be a great advantage from an economic and environmental perspective. A scale with the percentages of addition of ash in relation to cement (5, 10, 15 and 20%) was designed and the replacement of sand by this material, as well as the addition of an inert material such as marble dust. For a better understanding about how these mixtures behave in other cementitious systems, thermogravimetric analysis were performed on pastes with curing ages of 7, 28 and 90Â d, and physical and mechanical tests on mortars cured for 28 and 90Â d. It was proved that the addition of SSA in concrete used for manufacturing blocks cured for 28Â d provided densities and resistances similar to the control sample (without SSA) and significantly reduces the water absorption. The replacement of sand by the mineral addition significantly improves the parameters mentioned above.",
        "Due to a growing public interest in increasing water consumption and associated water scarcity, many methods and indicators for measuring and assessing freshwater usage have evolved. However, what is still missing is a low-effort approach for corporate water accounting along entire supply chains that provides valuable decision-making aid for companies seeking to improve sustainable water management along their value chain. This paper introduces a new method for corporate water accounting, the Regionalized Cumulative Water Intensity (RCWI), and investigates its practical applicability through a case study in the cotton textile chain. The results of this case study show that the concept is suitable for assessing and comparing the water performance of different suppliers and supplier combinations whereby not only environmental and economic but also social aspects can be considered. Moreover, the indirect responsibility that a company bears for the water use of its suppliers is reflected in its own water performance results. Through purchasing less, more or other pre-products as well as through deliberate supplier selection a company has a non-negligible influence on this.",
        "Water footprinting (WF) is mooted to quantify the impacts of production on water resources. The impact of the rain-fed potato (Solanum tuberosum) production on water resources was assessed for a kilogram of potatoes at the packhouse gate. The hydrological water-balance method was used and this accounts for all inflows and outflows to quantify the net use of groundwater as the blue WF, and that of the soil-water store as the green WF. The green WF was found to be negligible. The blue WF was negative atÂ âˆ’67Â L/kg. Thus rain-fed potato production here has no deleterious impacts on the water quantity. The grey WF, the water required to â€˜diluteâ€™ NO3â€“N in the drainage to meet the drinking water standard, was 61Â L/kg, of which 56Â L/kg was from the cropping stage. The impact of the packhouse phase and the background system was found to be small. However, the average leached NO3â€“N concentration of 11.3Â mg/L, which is just at the drinking water standard, and the loading of 27.8Â kg-N/ha/y during cultivation indicate that a single application of fertilizer at the time of planting has impacts on water quality. Our modelling of different fertilizer application scenarios of two splits, three splits and a late application at 55Â days after planting reduced the annual average NO3â€“N concentrations to 10.5, 10.3 and 9.5Â mg/L respectively. Potato yield was not compromised. The grey WF would be reduced to 50.6, 50.9 and 48.9Â L/kg respectively for these fertilizer scenarios.",
        "Spills due to the floating oil on the surface of sea water shows a significant alteration in the natural phenomenon of the marine ecosystem. Hence, amphiphilic sodium salt of oleoyl carboxymethyl chitosan (NaO-CMCS) was synthesized, characterized and studied as a sustainable adsorbent for the removal of floating oil in the oil spill treatment. Successful chemical modification of chitosan was confirmed by chemical analysis using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Elemental Analyzer. The effect of pH and salinity on the surface charge of NaO-CMCS was studied. Marine diesel was chosen as an oil phase for the emulsion studies. Hydrophobically modified NaO-CMCS shows the oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion stability for more than 6 weeks with droplet size â‰¤ 30 Î¼m which increases with decreasing temperature. The behavior of emulsion with different salinity shows phase separation at pH 5, bridging flocculation at pH 6â€“7 and o/w emulsion at pH 8. Calcium ions act as a cross-linker between two carboxylic acid groups of NaO-CMCS, enhancing the removal of oil from the creamy emulsion. The recovery of oil was 75â€“85% and 19â€“49% from deionized water and sea water, respectively. Oil was not chemically altered during the recovery, demonstrating the effectiveness of this derivative in the oil spill response for the removal and recovery of floating oil from the sea water.",
        "In the context of considerable change in the use of groundwater pattern, particularly with continuously increasing demand for groundwater due to growing population, expansion of area under irrigation and economic progress, the present paper makes an attempt to delineate groundwater potential zones using integrated remote sensing, geographic information system, and analytic hierarchy process techniques. Integration of geographic information system with analytic hierarchy process can exemplify as a process that transforms and harmonizes geographical data and weightage ranking to retrieve information for accurate decision-making. Accordingly, mapping and identification of groundwater potential zones are carried out in the Ganga Alluvial Plain of Hooghly district of India. Application of the same for Indo-Gangetic plain is made (new approach) to contribute the applicability Geographic Information System and Analytic Hierarchy Process for the delineation of groundwater potential zone. Predominant criteria (e.g., land use, land cover, soil type, geomorphology, geology, elevation, slope, rainfall, normalized difference vegetation index, drainage density, recharge rate, groundwater depth) were employed for computation of groundwater potential index. Overlay weighted sum method is applied to integrate all thematic criteria to generate groundwater potential zone map of the study area. The resulting groundwater potential index map has been classified into three groundwater potential zones, namely good, moderate and poor. Finally, groundwater potential zone map is validated using average groundwater level data from 32 wells scattered over the study area. The findings of the present paper have important implications for designing sustainable groundwater plan in the area.",
        "The grand challenge of accessing fresh water and sanitation is a global concern. The intensity of challenge depends on the geographical location as well as the level of socio-economic development of individual countries. The present paper first reviews the key water-related global trends and examines the global agenda on water issues. Next the focus is turned on Russia. Despite of being one of the water-rich countries in the world, Russia faces a number of substantial administrative and structural issues in the water sector. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a long-term strategy for the management of this infinite, but strategic resource. The present paper develops long-term scenarios and strategies for the Russian water sector towards the year 2030. The study draws upon an earlier horizon scanning activity that identified a set of global trends and uncertainties related to water sector. This horizon scanning work is extended into alternative futures for the Russian water sector by using a combination of Foresight methods including scenario analysis, data mining, and various expert methods. Scenarios developed are characterized by a set of qualitative and quantitative factors and indicators of future developments in three key domains for the water sector: (i) the sustainability of water systems; (ii) water use by households and industry; and (iii) new water products and services. Scenarios present four alternative trajectories for the water sector that may also be applied for certain countries whose water sector is comparable with the Russia. Among the scenarios developed in the study, it is concluded that the most probable ones are Problem conservation and Losses and accidents. However, there is a possibility to revert these scenarios into more desirable trajectories, which are presented in other scenarios. For instance, a variety of new clean water technologies may be widely applied to achieve the Nearly perfect future (visionary) scenario.",
        "The broad scope and definition of sustainability has perplexed assessment of water infrastructure systems, especially for the purpose of directing engineering practices when quantified criteria are desired. An input-oriented data envelopment analysis (DEA) was improved to benchmark the relative sustainability of the water infrastructure of 157 cities in China. The DEA calculates a single sustainability score using seven inputs and five outputs that represent the economic, resource and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Overall, 69 out of the 157 sampled systems obtained high sustainability scores. Eight specific efficiency indicators based on individual DEA input to output ratio were evaluated to identify the causes of performance differences. Compared to water supply systems, the performance of wastewater treatment plants has greater influence on the sustainability score of the overall system. For all systems, the sustainability scores are more sensitive to sludge production and electricity consumption than capital investment and removal efficiency of treatment processes. The DEA provides guidelines to cities for setting priorities in order to meet specific sustainability criteria. Statistical analysis indicates that the overall sustainability score primarily depends on the system scale, meteorological conditions such as air temperature and rainfall, and source water quality.",
        "Innovation systems theory stresses the central importance of knowledge and the transfer of knowledge between the different actors of an innovation system, yet there are no methodological tools to systematically analyse the dynamics of such relationships. In this paper, we propose a multi-disciplinary approach drawing on social psychology to integrate innovation systems and knowledge transfer theory. We focus the empirical efforts for validating this approach in the water sector. Although Water Operator Partnerships are conceptualised to share best practices via knowledge transfer, our findings based on empirical evidence indicate clear points of consensus as well as issues of conflict in the dynamics of knowledge transfer between water operators engaged in such partnerships. The results indicate qualitative differences in goals of knowledge transfer as well as sources of differences and asymmetries in motivations, pressures and capabilities in the knowledge transfer process.",
        "The complexity of the challenges in the water sector means that innovative solutions are required. These solutions include not only new sustainable technologies for water treatment, but also complementary innovation in business models to support the adoption of these technologies in urban areas. This paper aims to explore the role of sustainable business models in supporting technological innovations such as decentralized approaches for water quality and quantity improvements in urban areas. The private sector involvement can be valuable in overcoming the barriers and challenges to implementation of those approaches as well as to achieve the sustainability. A case study of the product-service system as a sustainable business model in an emerging economy was conducted to deliver insights into the role of new ways of value proposition, value creation, and value capture in supporting innovative technologies in the water sector and in contributing to sustainability. The results demonstrated that consumers' acceptance, risk perception, and confidence in decentralized approaches can be improved with the support of business models through a close integration with customers. The close integration among the actors can also lead to better management of the system. Further research can focus on how different types of sustainable business models could contribute to supporting water technologies in urban areas and increase social acceptability.",
        "Information and communication technologies have the potential to increase productivity, improving efficiency and eventually raising the quality of water services. Although this potential is recognized, great variation exists in the way water utilities adopt information and communication technologies. Based on literature review and empirical data drawn from the three case studies (a municipality in Greece, an airport in Italy and a water utility in the Netherlands) developed under the EU-funded Waternomics project the paper highlights how environmental, organizational and individual factors explain technology adoption. The paper pays particular attention to the idiosyncrasies of the water services sector, which influence this process. These include include the social and conomic importance of water supply, the monopolistic nature of the sector and increased commercialization of public water utilities. Our cases suggest that drivers of technology adoption appear to be somewhat ambiguous in the water services sector, in that they impact adoption in diverse locations differently. Our cases also suggest is that the prioritization of the factors that determine adoption are dynamic and change over time.",

        "The urgent need for innovation to address multifaceted and intertwined water-related challenges is becoming increasingly clear, acknowledged and responded to with cumulating sources and amounts of funding. Nevertheless, the water sector has been claimed to be less innovative than other sectors. This Special Volume on the dynamics of water innovation is based on the realization that, in general, there is a striking absence of academic studies on the dynamics of water innovation. This SV is therefore designed to lay the foundations for the field of water innovation studies, in an effort to integrate the emerging insights. Together, the contributions in this SV capture the current understanding of the dynamics of water innovation and provide insights into how the water innovation process can be fostered. The purpose of this introductory article is threefold, namely to frame the discussion on water innovation dynamics in order to contextualise the contributions of this SV, to provide systematic guidance for studying water innovation dynamics and to suggest the way forward for water innovation studies. It captures the extent of the field of water innovation studies with a review of the literature of the last three decades and frames water innovations. Based on five decades of innovation research and drawing on three areas (management, strategy and policy), we provide an innovation studies taxonomy that consists of four organising dimensions: type of innovation, stage of innovation, level of analysis and measurement. This taxonomy enables researchers to study the dynamics of water innovation from different combinations of conceptual and thematic angles, drawing on the field of innovation studies in a systematic fashion. Finally, we reflect on the way forward for water innovation studies with suggestions for future research.",
        "The European Innovation Partnership on Water is an experimental, demand-driven, and flexible initiative within the framework of the EU 2020 Innovation Union; its overall objective is to facilitate the development of more innovative solutions to our water challenges.

        "The interlinkage between the food, energy and water (FEW) supply systems, known as the nexus, has received considerable attention in recent years. Despite this intense interest, there is little work focusing on how to design a sustainable FEW system that can consistently meet its food, energy, and water demands. In an effort to better understand the dynamics among the nexus, the scope of the study is limited to a small-scale FEW system that can consistently yield food for a family of four (two adults and two children) and collect or recycle its own water and supply its own energy needs through solar panels (electricity demand). In order to determine the influence of each component (i.e. food, water, or energy) on the system's output and identify the weakest link of the system (e.g. water scarcity, energy shortage, inconsistent supply of food, etc.), a quantitative modeling is used to calculate the total cost of sustainable FEW systems. The impact of each design decision variable (e.g. size of the system, water recycling capacity, solar system) on the system's output is formulated and then optimized. The model is analyzed for two different climate scenarios; a cloudy and humid scenario and sunny and arid scenario. In both scenarios, the energy component represents a large portion of the system's total cost (around 86% in the humid climate and 73% in the arid climate). This shows that innovative energy production technologies are needed to improve the sustainability of FEW systems at a reasonable cost.",
        "Higher Education Institutions are becoming increasingly more aware of the need to join forces to contribute to making societies more sustainable. Developing innovation capabilities is one of the ways that has been identified to contribute in this respect. Within organizations, building capacity for innovation is critical across all sectors. Given this situation, the present article describes and tests a knowledge alliance in the water sector. The alliance in question has been established between universities and companies with the aim of reducing the gap between graduate-acquired and employer-required competences, especially regarding innovation capabilities, by means of international internships. The article provides a theoretical foundation regarding the concern for sustainability in two ways: i) by proposing competence-based education and learning as a more sustainable model compared to traditional approaches and (ii) identifying competences required and practiced in water innovation projects as a means of building more sustainable companies and ultimately societies. The empirical evidence is taken from a pan-European project, AQUAdemia, which is being implemented in five countries and has resulted in 18 pilot internships. The main result consists in providing an international multi-stakeholder collaboration formula through which future workforces are better trained for business needs. The theoretical value of this article is its focus on the intersection of three aspects (education, innovation and the water sector), since previous research has only relied on single topic or dual approaches.",
        "Objective The objective of this work was to determine the effects and implications of generic and site-specific aquatic eutrophication potential indicators in the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of livestock farm systems using a New Zealand (NZ) lake catchment case study. Method Average dairy and sheep & beef farm systems in the Lake Taupo catchment were studied. Emissions of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to waterways, and ammonia and nitrogen oxides to air from these farms were calculated using the site-specific OVERSEERÂ® nutrient budget model. These emissions data were then used to calculate the increase in nutrients in water bodies and aquatic Eutrophication indicators with a range of Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods. Results Eutrophication indicator results varied considerably depending on the environmental mechanisms modelled by the LCIA method for the fate of N and P, accentuated by different choices for the inventory modelling. Using default emission factors instead of site-specific ones overestimated eutrophication impact results. The most recent methods are not only spatially-explicit and applicable beyond Europe, but they also account for more environmental mechanisms for the fate of the nutrients, giving relatively lower calculated impact results. However, the appropriate scale and spatial resolution is still a crucial question to address for these methods since they greatly affect results. Regarding eutrophication damage assessment, when the actual background nutrient concentration is very low, the end-point assessment method for freshwater eutrophication is not applicable. In this case, LCA fails to account for a high standard of water quality that is in a near-pristine state, but deteriorating. Conclusions The inventory of nutrient flows at a farm scale and fate factors modelled at a catchment scale should be site-specific. Freshwater eutrophication indicators should be based on a site-specific (and globally-valid) LCIA model rather than a generic one. Currently-accepted freshwater eutrophication indicators focus only on P, thus capturing only part of the problem for freshwater bodies that are co-limited by N and P (in terms of algal growth) such as Lake Taupo in NZ. Lake Taupo water quality concerns and regulations are not focused on P, but solely on N due to increasing N levels over time. Conclusions from this study are valid beyond NZ and beyond agricultural systems. Future work needs to investigate coupling N and P fate modelling based on the most recent globally-valid and spatially-explicit LCIA methods.",
        "International headlines over the last few years have been dominated by extreme weather events, and floods have been amongst the most frequent and devastating. These disasters represent high costs and functional disruptions to societies and economies. The consequent breakdown of the economic equilibrium exacerbates the losses of the initial physical damages and generates indirect costs that largely amplify the burden of the total damage. Neglecting indirect damages results in misleading results regarding the real dimensions of the costs and prevents accurate decision-making in flood risk management. To obtain an accurate assessment of total flooding costs, this paper introduces the flood footprint concept, as a novel accounting framework that measures the total economic impact that is directly and indirectly caused to the productive system, triggered by the flooding damages to the productive factors, infrastructure and residential capital. The assessment framework account for the damages in the flooded region as well as in wider economic systems and social networks. The flood footprint builds on previous research on disaster impact analysis based on Input-Output methodology, which considers inter-industry flows of goods and services for economic output. The framework was applied to the 2007 summer floods in the UK to determine the total economic impact in the region of Yorkshire and The Humber. The results suggest that the total economic burden of the floods was approximately 4% of the region's GVA (Â£2.7 billion), from which over half comes from knock-on effects during the 14 months that the economy of Yorkshire and The Humber last to recover. This paper is the first to apply the conceptual framework of flood footprint to a real past event, by which it highlights the economic interdependence among industrial sectors. Through such interrelationships, the economic impacts of a flooding event spill over into the entire economic system, and some of the most affected sectors can be those that are not directly damaged. Neglecting the impact of indirect damages would underestimate the total social costs of flooding events, and mislead the correspondent actions for risk management and adaptation.",
        "South Africa is a semi-arid developing country facing water and energy insecurity. There are colossal challenges in reliably providing these resources amid growing population, increased urbanization and improved living standards causing increased demand for these resources. Development of new supply centralized systems comes at an exorbitant cost, whereas decentralized systems are touted as an attractive alternative. Grey water recycling and rain water harvesting at buildings level is such an alternative that can provide water for non-potable uses. However, there are technological challenges of optimally operating such systems while ensuring efficient use of associated energy. This paper introduces two control strategies; open loop optimal control and closed-loop model predictive control (MPC) strategies aimed at ensuring safe and reliable operation of the grey water recycling and rain water harvesting system while efficiently using associated energy. From the case study, the proposed system with either control strategy can save the cost of water and waste water by up to 32.3% and 29.5% respectively, while leading to 35.7% in energy cost savings and 31.5% in total operational cost savings in a month. Adoption of these systems would have a huge environmental effect in reducing demand for sewerage services, conservation of water hence reducing demand for potable water as well as increasing the energy efficiency. Furthermore, the system would increase the reliability and security of water supply. Despite the benefits, the system does not pay within its lifetime and therefore, government intervention is required so as to make it economically attractive. High cost of implementation coupled with low potable and waste water tariffs harbour adoption of these systems. Appropriate regulations, policies, incentives and public education are necessary to support such novel technologies in ensuring resource conservation, efficiency and security are achieved.",
        "Wastewater treatment facilities are increasingly being considered as centralized installations where various resources can be recovered from the sewage. Novel technological solutions are already available for achieving this goal. However, their application to upgrade existing plants can be far more challenging than building new dedicated plants. While the scientific literature is generally focused on testing and comparing the recovery options, this work was aimed at giving a holistic evaluation of the actual impacts of upgrading existing facilities. Commercially available systems were considered for retrofitting two plants of different size (50,000 and 500,000 population equivalents) and achieving either energy self-sufficiency or material recovery. Based on mass and energy balances, a detailed evaluation of technical, social, economic, and administrative aspects was carried out. Environmental aspects were also included, adopting a simplified approach. It turned out that energy self-sufficiency (external energy supply reduced down to about 10% of the total need) is not far away to be achieved, with moderate techno-economic implications, especially when the plant is already equipped with primary sedimentation and anaerobic digestion. Integral recovery of treated effluent, sludge and nitrogen can also be pursued in large facilities, while several potential criticalities arise for medium-sized plants. The adopted procedure evidenced critical aspects that are often disregarded in the decision process: this may suggest where to address efforts in evaluating real situations.",

        "As arid regions face increasing pressures on their water resources, the challenge of securing an adequate supply of good quality water to meet growing demands calls for innovative approaches that involve a diversification of water supply options and improved management of wastewater. Water recycling is a disruptive innovation that can help to achieve this goal in arid countries if the appropriate technical and institutional barriers are broken down. Within the water innovation literature, key questions remain as to the nature of the process and of the temporal dynamics of a shift towards decentralized wastewater infrastructure. This study offers insights into these mechanics using the Framework for Analyzing a Multi-level Innovation System (FAMIS), a cross-sectoral model that draws on the theories of technological innovation systems, system dynamics, transitions of socio-technical regimes, and evolutionary theories of technology. Cases from three water-scarce countries with distinct political economiesâ€”Australia, the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) and Jordanâ€”were used to document the dynamics of innovation in the water recycling system and identify policy solutions. Despite important contextual differences, in the three cases examined, actors and institutions have dynamically interacted to create a small niche where water recycling has emerged as a viable technology. Yet the application of the FAMIS model revealed that the dominant regime of water management has not been fundamentally altered due to blockages mainly at two â€œstagesâ€ of the FAMIS innovation lifecycle: the selection and adoption stages. We identified cross-geographical socio-technical and environmental characteristics and common mechanisms that strongly influence the evolution of water recycling technology through the innovation system. We find that the water-recycling technology evolves into the later stages of the innovation system in Australia, with the chokepoint occurring most importantly within the sophisticated but fragmented institutions that regulate water recycling. In the U.A.E., while agricultural reuse is widespread (to a larger extent than in Australia), major barriers occur earlier in the system, leaving mainly the water recycling technologies in the early stages of the system, where policy-induced path dependency block most selection mechanisms. With a wider infrastructural and institutional gap, Jordan may actually face less stringent barriers to water-recycling developments throughout all stages of the innovation system, namely influenced by international donors. Policy recommendations derived from this work to address barriers at the selection and adoption stages include favoring a coordinated institutional long-term vision and planning to overcome path dependence, enhancing social acceptance and adequate implementation of laws and regulations, and supporting data acquisition and model developments to build a stronger business case for water recycling.",

        "With the intensification of ecological and environmental problems due to increasing demand for resources, cleaner production (CP) is required to improve the production system for simultaneous resource conservation and environmental protection especially in the heavy pollution industries. Material flow analysis (MFA) is an effective way to investigate the causes of system problems, and however, interpretation of MFA results is one of the difficulties to convey meaningful information to CP decision makers. In this paper, a new evaluation method is proposed to interpret the results of MFA for CP implementation. Based on the concentration/dilution characteristics of the substance, two novel indicators (S and Î”S) were devised to quantify the hazardous potential and the resource potential of the flows, respectively, for CP opportunities identification and CP strategies selection. The evaluation method in combination with MFA is applied to the wastewater reduction in zinc electrolysis cellhouse. Results showed that in comparison with traditional indicators based on mass unit, S and Î”S integrated various dimensions of flow properties into single feature, which enabled comparing the quantity and quality of different zinc flows in a straightforward way. The two indicators are highly sensitive to the changes of the processes in the micro-scale material flow system, and are informative in CP decision-making by linking up the flow features with subsequent CP actions. The reduction potential of 97.3% of zinc emission and 70.6% of fresh water consumption in the case study was indicated by the evaluation and further validated by the implementation of CP in practice. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the evaluation method to improve the transparency of the material transformation/transfer in MFA and the advantages to better identify the underlying structure of CP strategy decision problem especially when the target substance serves as both resource and pollutant.",
        "Future scenarios modeling has been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of urban stormwater infrastructure and to cater to potential future changes. The changes of quantity and quality of urban stormwater, and attributable to climate change and urbanization, were examined and tested in four urban catchments based on future scenarios modeling. Based on our findings, we observed that there were different degrees of performance corresponding to 2-, 10-, and 100-year design storms. However, the general patterns and insights deduced were similar: (1) the peak runoff and water quality appeared to be impacted more significantly by urbanization factors than that due to climate change; (2) the influence from urbanization (increase intensity of land use and population density) was found to be more significant than that from land-use changes alone; (3) catchments with relatively rapid developing rates appeared to produce more serious adverse influence on the stormwater quabntity and quality; and (4) low impact developments as key adaptation practices could be potentially effective in mitigating adverse impacts of future changes on urban stormwater system. The methodology developed in this study could be useful for urban stormwater planning and testing the plan against future change scenarios as a result of urbanization and climate change.",
        "Rapid economic development has significantly degraded the environmental quality of Erhai Lake and its basin. In order to assess the present sustainability of Erhai Lake Basin and suggest improvement options, this study builds an emergy-based framework, in which the whole basin system comprises five sub-systems divided according to local economic structure and lake functions, including Erhai Lake sub-system, Fishery sub-system, Agricultural sub-system, Industrial sub-system and Household sub-system. Moreover, emergy performances of lake water consumption are analyzed considering the vital role of lake water in the basin development. The results of emergy-based indicators, e.g. EYR (1.31), ELR (60.98), ESI (2.15E-02) and support area SA(r) (1.56E+05Â km2, about 60 times the actually available area), reveal that the whole basin is far away from sustainable development. The key factor is the strong reliance on nonrenewable resources, especially in the form of purchased resources (76.48% of total emergy used). In particular, cement industry and transportation equipment industry within the industrial sub-system, as well as massive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticide in the agricultural sub-system, are the main contributors to the overall emergy inputs. e Regarding to water consumption, agriculture is the dominant sector by volume, but with a low use efficiency, while industrial water use has the largest environmental impact due to its high water quality requirement. Policy insights for improving the overall sustainability of Erhai Lake Basin are proposed, including adjusting industrial structure and promoting circular economy, facilitating green agriculture, improving water efficiency and increasing renewable energy use.",
        "In situ bioremediation has been applied to remediate trichloroethylene (TCE)-contaminated groundwater, and primary substrates need to be supplied to enhance the reductive dechlorination. Gamma poly-glutamic acid (Î³-PGA) is a natural occurring and biodegradable biopolymer, which consists of glutamic acid monomers crosslinked between Î³-carboxyl and Î±-amino functional groups. Microcosm experiments were performed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of TCE dechlorination using Î³-PGA as the primary substrate. The dominant dechlorinating bacteria and bacterial communities were determined using nucleotide sequence analyses and 16S rRNA-based denatured-gradient-gel electrophoresis profiling. The variations in Dehalococcoides spp. (DHC) were evaluated using the real-time polymerase chain reaction technique. Results show that Î³-PGA supplement created anaerobic conditions and resulted in significant increase of total organic carbon [1930â€¯mg/L (1â€¯mL Î³-PGA in 30â€¯mL groundwater)]. About 99% of TCE (initial concentrationâ€¯=â€¯4.3â€¯mg/L) was degraded after 85 days and acidification was not observed because the released amine from Î³-PGA could react with water and form ammonia, which resulted in alkaline conditions due to its basic characteristic. Solution pH was maintained neutral and benefited the growth of DHC. The supplement of Î³-PGA enhanced the growth of DHC from 1.03â€¯Ã—â€¯104 to 2.6â€¯Ã—â€¯106 gene copies/g soil, and the TCE dechlorination rate was enhanced. The increase in ethene concentrations indicated the complete TCE dechlorination with Î³-PGA addition. Î³-PGA globule (with a zeta potential ofÂ âˆ’19.8 mv) had three major diameters in micro to nano-scale ranges. This allowed Î³-PGA to migrate into different soil formations and distribute within soil pores evenly. Results suggest that Î³-PGA can be used as the carbon substrate to enhance the efficiency of reductive dechlorination of chlorinated compounds.",
        "Water and food are facing increased demands from larger and more affluent populations thus necessitating a coordinated and effective management of limited natural resources. In this study, we present an optimization model developed for optimal resource allocation towards sustainable water and food security under nutritional, socio-economic, agricultural, environmental, and natural resource constraints. The core objective of this model is to maximize the composite water-food security status by defining an optimal water and agricultural policy that ensures nutritional guidelines while still maintaining food-preferences. This policy transforms optimum food demands into optimum cropping options given the water and land footprints of each crop or agricultural product. The model performance is evaluated with a hypothetical regional case study testing a wide spectrum of cases from the water-stressed to the land-stressed extremes thus showing the model's ability to suggest fundamentally different policy approaches. Results demonstrated the sensitivity of adopted water and food security definitions in shaping water and agricultural policies, thus reinforcing the need for agreements amongst the wide range of stakeholders at global scale."
        "The paper explores the November 2015 Samarco tailings dam disaster in Brazil, the largest in the world according to many criteria, and its impact on water risk management. Focus is on BHP and Vale, as two of the world's largest mining companies and their exposure to water risk through the disaster and their responses as equal owners of the Samarco joint venture. The study employs a case study method based on publicly available data in which the companies' water risk management is assessed. The analysis reveals a number of issues which include too much discretion given to joint ventures in the assessment of water risk and the need for a specialized water risk function and improved contingency planning for downstream communities impacted by the organization's activities. Based on the analysis a future research agenda is developed.",
        "Converting abundant and renewable wastes to high-value products is important based on economic and environmental viewpoints. In this work, wheat straw ash was used as a precursor for the synthesis of NaY zeolite. The characteristics and effectiveness of NaY as adsorbent for tetracycline (TC) were evaluated. The adsorption behavior of TCâ€“NaY system under different experimental conditions was also illustrated. The Langmuir equation was well applied for the analysis of isotherm data, with maximum equilibrium uptakes of 201.77, 218.51, and 230.69Â mg/g at 30Â Â°C, 40Â Â°C, and 50Â Â°C, respectively. Data on TC uptakes versus time followed a pseudo-second order kinetic model. NaY zeolite with a surface area of 657.44Â m2/g and pore volume of 0.341Â cm3/g could be an efficient adsorbent for the treatment of antibiotic pollutants in wastewater. "
        "Ensuring secure access to food and energy worldwide relies on win-win share of sectoral use of constrained natural resources such as land and water, taking also into account the crucial role of ecosystems and their services. The increase in global population and the related growing demand for food and other services are exerting unsustainable pressures on natural resources, compromising their use within the ecosystemsâ€™ carrying capacity. Progressively, studies and initiatives have been developed with the aim of identifying win-win share strategies, which may compensate the sectoral demands of natural resources, addressing the need of a holistic and interdisciplinary nexus approach. In this study, thus emphasizing the importance of a holistic approach and highlighting the fundamental role of ecosystems, we propose a synthesis matrix system that describes the complex and closely bound relationship between natural resources use for food (specifically water, land), energy (defined as ecosystem service flows in our matrix system) and ecosystems, along the lines of the concept of ecosystem-water-food-land-energy nexus. The synthesis matrix system could be defined for different scales, both from the global to the local scale and has been designed to include impacts and nexus with climate change. The matrix aims at integrating quantitative and qualitative aspects, which are often neglected in traditional approaches of impact assessment. The complexity of the interactions between the different components of the nexus requires relying not only on quantitative evidences but also on expert judgment. A sensitivity check has been conducted to illustrate how to verify the convergence of expert-judgment from different experts. Moreover, being the matrix meant for supporting holistic assessment of supply chain, in the present study, the integration of the matrix within life cycle assessment (LCA) is proposed. However, in order to support the analysis of interconnections among impacts, further methodological development of the LCA methods is needed. An illustrative example related to the competition for water, land and food bioenergy production is depicted. The matrices show that there are predominantly negative impacts given by sectoral uses of resources on the provision of ecosystem services, an issue that requires most focus on resource efficiency and on the environmental and economic impacts of natural resources use while reducing the trade-offs between the sectoral demands.",
        "With increasing water and energy use in the residential sector, due to population growth, urbanization, and climate change, demand-side management (DSM) is essential to complement supply-side interventions to meet future demands and reduce costs. This paper explores how customer segmentation analysis can support customized water and electricity DSM. We contribute a three-phase customer segmentation analysis of over 1000 residential accounts in the Los Angeles County (Southern California) to explore the heterogeneity of residential water-electricity demand profiles and provide insights for coordinated water-energy DSM. Results show that, on the one hand, daily water and electricity consumption are correlated, thus groups of high consumers can be targeted with coordinated water-electricity DSM interventions. On the other hand, the absence of a relevant causal nexus between water and electricity daily load shapes suggests that DSM actions for water should be differentiated from those for electricity. Finally, both objective (e.g., presence of swimming pool) and subjective psychographic features (e.g., conservation attitude) are found to be relevant potential drivers of water-electricity demands. Based on these findings, we propose recommendations for designing a portfolio of mixed customized water-electricity DSM interventions to foster conservation or peak shifting objectives.",
        "Improving the management of the urban water cycle can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to climate change mitigation in cities. Stormwater in urban areas has traditionally been collected and conveyed to sewage treatment plants, a practice that has continued with the need to manage increased superficial flow. This paper presents the Low Impact Development (LID) measures to improve water management in the new urban development of Valdebebas in Madrid, and the associated benefits. Stormwater was considered a sub cycle; by shortening the water cycle the local use of rainwater was achieved while reducing energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions for off-site treatment. The article analyses the urban water cycle from a preventive approach. It considers how urban design features such as topography and pavement selection were used to convey surface water from impermeable areas to permeable ones (vegetated or permeable pavements) and the infiltration of water into engineered soil, reducing the need for off-site conveyance infrastructure, and the amount of water discharged into municipal treatment installations. Moreover, the captured water increases soil water content available for plants and trees which play an important role in absorbing CO2. Water exceeding soil capacity is collected in the subsurface Sustainable Drainage system (SuDS), including infiltration boxes where water is temporarily stored before moving through the soil toward ground water reserves. This paper describes the approaches and criteria used to design a large scale SuDS infrastructure in the district of Valdebebas, in northeastern Madrid (Spain), and analyses its performance, followed by a comparison with the predictions under three climate change scenarios, which consider not only the variation in peak flows and runoff, but also the reduction in GHG emissions. Additionally, it presents a sensitivity analysis for the main variables in the design of SuDS, and a multicriteria analysis, to compare the different drainage systems.",
        "Much of North China, including the Beijing municipality, is impacted by high levels of water scarcity. As a countermeasure, since the 1990s, Beijing and Hebei Provinces have jointly initiated a series of ecological engineering programs that have the potential to be replicated throughout the region. This study reports on an evaluation of one such program - the Paddy Land-to-Dry Land (PLDL) program - that operated between 2006 and 2015 and involved an incentive payment to farmers to cultivate spring maize instead of paddy rice. The evaluation included a range of water consumption and water degradation indicators based on water footprint and life cycle assessment methodologies. The program was found to be a success in reducing irrigation water demand in each of the three counties where it was implemented: Chicheng, Fengning and Luanping. However, assessment by various indicators, such as the grey water footprint, freshwater eutrophication potential and freshwater ecosystem quality, indicated potential increased risks to water quality, largely related to the higher applications of fertilizer associated with maize cropping. This study demonstrates the importance of using a broad range of indicators when evaluating an ecological engineering project, as well as the potential for such programs to have unintended negative impacts.",
        "Developed to deal with water allocation problems (WAP), the Water Source Diagram (WSD) method is here extended to be used in problems involving fixed flowrate operations in multiple contaminant processes, as well as processes formulated by the source and sink point of view. Therefore the WSD becomes a complete methodology to solve WAPs without regenerating operations focusing maximum water reuse. To illustrate the performance of the proposed extension, two case studies handling hybrid systems from the pulp and paper industry are presented, including industrial data from a Brazilian pulp and paper plant. The WSD results are also compared with other author's proposals, showing good performance.",
        "Understanding of the trend in water use with possible relation to economic development is essential for forecasting future water demand and developing response strategies. The environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis asserts that pollution emissions and natural resource use often follow an inverted-U shape. This paper develops a piecewise Mann-Kendall method to address inverted-U shape detection based on a non-parametric approach. P-values of the piecewise Mann-Kendall method statistic are identified using the exhaustion method, approximation method or analytic method, depending on the data size. Tests of the piecewise Mann-Kendall method on synthetic data indicate that the developed method provides reasonable type I error and power. The method is successfully applied to pattern detection in real water use. Water uses in a few countries and provinces in China present the environmental Kuznets curve. Unlike the traditional parametric quadratic regression method which is sensitive to data skewness, this non-parametric method offers consistent environmental Kuznets curve detection regardless of the original or logarithmic form of data being used.

        "Water utilities draw different water sources (surface and groundwater), including increased use of alternative sources (e.g. desalinated water, reused water, inter-basin water transfers) to supply freshwater to different users (domestic, agriculture, etc.). The combination of water sources and technologies (including infrastructures and energy) results in a regional water supply mix (WSmix) for each specific use. Existing Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) databases used in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), do not include these mixes when modelling processes, leading to a poor representation of water supply systems and related environmental impacts. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a consistent framework for modelling a regional WSmix at worldwide scale. The WSmix framework includes the scope and system boundaries definition as well as a standardisation of terminology and classification of water sources and users. To facilitate implementation of the WSmix, this paper provides a worldwide database of water source mixes per user and a technology matrix linking water sources to water production technologies, including the connection with the local electricity mix. The relevance of including the WSmix in LCI databases for proper water-use impact assessment is demonstrated with an illustrative case study. The paper finally concludes on the need of using the regionalized WSmix in routine LCA, which is just as straightforward as the use of the regionalized electricity supply mix. Besides, the developed WSmix provides interesting insights beyond the LCA scope to support the strategic management of water sources at various scales including the global scale.",

        "Vehicle emissions are one of the important sources of air pollution in urban areas. This study analyzed emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon dioxide (CO2), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from gasoline, diesel, and compressed natural gas (CNG)-powered vehicles, including passenger cars, trucks, and taxis under real-traffic conditions. These pollutants and greenhouse gas were collected and measured through on-road experiments using a specifically designed portable emission measurement system (PEMS) on two testing routes. The results indicated significant variations in emission factors across vehicle and fuel types. Gasoline vehicles exhibited higher CO and CO2 emission factors than their diesel and CNG counterparts. However, diesel vehicles produced significantly more NOx and PM2.5 emissions. Among all vehicle categories, light-duty gasoline trucks (LDGTs) and medium-duty gasoline passenger vehicles (MDGVs) had the highest CO emissions (10.3 g km− 1 and 8.0 g km− 1, respectively). Heavy-duty diesel passenger vehicles (HDDVs) emitted the most NOx (10.1 g km− 1) and CO2 (1109.4 g km− 1). Light-duty diesel trucks (LDDTs) and medium-duty diesel trucks (MDDTs) contributed the highest PM2.5 emissions (295.2 mg km− 1 and 769.4 mg km− 1, respectively). Compressed natural gas vehicles were the cleanest, with emission values of 3.4 g km− 1 (CO), 0.76 g km− 1 (NOx), 321.6 g km− 1 (CO2), and 1.4 mg km− 1 (PM2.5). Furthermore, while stricter emission standards help reduce pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, increasing mileage is a major contributor to increased emission levels. Additionally, an estimation of CO, NOx, CO2, and PM2.5 emissions from vehicle exhaust across 31 Chinese provinces in 2021 recognized high-emission vehicle types and revealed substantial regional variations in vehicle exhaust emissions. The findings from these on-road emission experiments provide essential insights for designing effective pollution control strategies and mitigating urban air pollution.",
        "Material transportation and on-site assembly are the building lifecycle phases that produce significant carbon emissions. However, traditional methods for capturing and recording these emissions lack automation, traceability, and immutability. This limitation hinders project stakeholders from data-driven decision-makings to promote sustainable construction practices and effectively implement regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a proof of concept for a transformational emissions ledger system that integrates an AI-powered large multimodal model for automatic parsing of emission-relevant data and a blockchain-enabled smart contract for a traceable and immutable emissions ledger. The proposed solution enables project stakeholders to automatically generate an immutable emissions ledger recorded on blockchain during the material transportation and on-site assembly phases, thereby enhancing their ability to make informed decisions regarding carbon emissions management. Additionally, this system enables regulatory approaches, including subsidies and tax incentives, all anchored in an immutable emissions ledger based on blockchain.",
        "The brewing industry confronts significant environmental challenges owing to the substantial CO? emissions and high energy consumption during the brewing process. To address these issues, this study proposes a sustainable platform for valorising spent brewer grain (BSG; a byproduct of the brewing industry) to reduce its carbon footprint. CO2 was utilised in the pyrolysis of BSG to enhance energy recovery in the form of pyrolytic gas while reducing carbon emissions. In the initial pyrolysis setup, the reactivity of CO? was limited owing to its low reactivity in the temperature range where most BSG-derived volatiles were generated. This limited the capability of CO? to enhance the thermal cracking of volatiles, thereby adversely affecting syngas production. To address this limitation, the setup was modified to provide additional thermal energy and incorporate a catalytic process. During catalytic pyrolysis, the presence of a catalyst significantly enhanced syngas production, and substantial CO? consumption was observed experimentally. The biosolid generated from catalytic pyrolysis was utilised for CO? capture. This dual approach (CO2-catalysed pyrolysis and subsequent CO2-adsorption using biosolids) reduced the net CO? emissions associated with brewing. Specifically, the CO? emissions for producing 1?L of beer were reduced from 202.7?g in non-catalytic pyrolysis to 11.5?g in the CO?-catalysed pyrolysis. Additionally, the pyrolytic gases (H2, CO, and CH4) produced through this process is sufficient to satisfy the energy demands of the brewing industry. This would reduce the reliance on fossil fuels. The study demonstrated that valorising BSG through co-catalysed pyrolysis provides a viable and economically feasible pathway for achieving carbon neutrality in the brewing sector. This approach provides a model for sustainable brewing practices by addressing energy recovery and carbon reduction.",
        "The food sector represents one of the largest contributors to global climate change, making it urgent for the public to transform their food consumption behavior. However, food consumption behaviors that can facilitate carbon reduction, and how to classify these behaviors from the perspective of behavioral science, have not been deeply explored. This study pioneers a novel categorization of carbon-mitigating food consumption behaviors based on an A-S-I framework (i.e., “Avoid” food loss and waste, “Shift” to low-carbon alternatives, and “Improve” dietary structure). Such a classification not only encompasses the full spectrum of emission-altering behaviors but also enables identification of common determinants across behavioral categories. Integrating existing behavioral theories and literature on the influencing factors of these behaviors, we systematically construct three models containing both constraints and motivating factors underpinning “A-S-I” behaviors. Our analysis reveals substantial variations in influencing factors across behavioral types. Notably, we found that factors such as face motivation, knowledge, and perceived behavioral control outweigh traditional psychological constructs (such as attitudes and norms) in predicting these behaviors among Chinese consumers. Based on these findings, we propose targeted measures to further enhance the feasibility of behavioral changes. These measures could effectively facilitate low-carbon dietary transformations, potentially generating dual benefits for climate change mitigation and food safety.",
        "As one quarter of global energy use serves the production of materials, the more efficient use of these materials presents a significant opportunity for the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With the renewed interest of policy makers in the circular economy, material efficiency (ME) strategies such as light-weighting and downsizing of and lifetime extension for products, reuse and recycling of materials, and appropriate material choice are being promoted. Yet, the emissions savings from ME remain poorly understood, owing in part to the multitude of material uses and diversity of circumstances and in part to a lack of analytical effort. We have reviewed emissions reductions from ME strategies applied to buildings, cars, and electronics. We find that there can be a systematic trade-off between material use in the production of buildings, vehicles, and appliances and energy use in their operation, requiring a careful life cycle assessment of ME strategies. We find that the largest potential emission reductions quantified in the literature result from more intensive use of and lifetime extension for buildings and the light-weighting and reduced size of vehicles. Replacing metals and concrete with timber in construction can result in significant GHG benefits, but trade-offs and limitations to the potential supply of timber need to be recognized. Repair and remanufacturing of products can also result in emission reductions, which have been quantified only on a case-by-case basis and are difficult to generalize. The recovery of steel, aluminum, and copper from building demolition waste and the end-of-life vehicles and appliances already results in the recycling of base metals, which achieves significant emission reductions. Higher collection rates, sorting efficiencies, and the alloy-specific sorting of metals to preserve the function of alloying elements while avoiding the contamination of base metals are important steps to further reduce emissions.",
        "Due to the growing challenges of road safety in light of environmental demands, the adoption of eco-driving practices presents a viable strategy for minimizing crash risks and lowering pollutant emissions. This study aims to examine the advantages of eco-driving in rural and mountainous rural settings by employing an experimental methodology with a driving simulator. Data was collected from 39 participants across a range of driving simulation scenarios, both before and after the implementation of eco-driving instruction. Furthermore, the characteristics of the participants were gathered evaluated through a questionnaire survey. Every participant undertook two drives for each simulation scenario, first under standard driving conditions and then with the implementation of eco-driving principles. In order to evaluate the effects of eco-driving on fuel consumption, crash probability, and pollutant emissions (CO2, CO, and NOx), linear and logistic regression models were implemented. The key findings indicate that eco-driving significantly reduces pollutant emissions (e.g., CO2 by 5.9 %, CO by 29.3 %, and NOx by 34.7 %), reduces fuel consumption by 7 %, and reduces the probability of crashes by 66.2 %. Quantitative analysis confirmed that mountainous rural networks, due to their topographical complexity, are associated with higher emissions, increased fuel consumption, and elevated crash risk compared to flatter rural environments, highlighting the need for terrain-specific eco-driving strategies. The findings highlight the promise of eco-driving practices in improving environmental sustainability and safety, particularly in rural environments. This supports the integration of eco-driving techniques into transportation policy and driver training programs aimed at fostering sustainable and safe driving behaviors.",
        "This study investigates how economic complexity, environmental governance, and geopolitical threats interact to affect CO2 emissions in OECD nations. The study proposes strategic options for energy transition by identifying the main drivers of carbon emissions and analyzing data from 1996 to 2019 using an asymmetric method and the Method of Moment Quantile Regression (MMQR) model. The results show that while geopolitical concerns increase environmental instability, economic complexity, and strong environmental governance are especially important in reducing emissions. Moreover, the report emphasizes governmental actions aligned with sustainable financing systems to assist low-carbon transitions. By providing focused advice for legislators to negotiate the complexity of decarburization while guaranteeing economic stability, the study adds to the increasing debate on energy strategy.",
        "Traditional JET fuels produced from petroleum sources contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, negatively impacting human health and the climate. Several studies have shown that sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) from feedstocks such as seed and non-seeds oil (palm, canola, sunflower, Karanja, camelina and Jatropha), waste cooking oil, recycled pork fat, and municipal waste have the potential to replace fossil JET fuels. These renewable fuels are made from natural sources, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study reviewed research conducted between 2017- February 2025. As a comparative analysis, it examined renewable and fossil JET fuel physicochemical characteristics: density, viscosity, calorific value, surface tension, freezing, and flash point. This comparative study assesses the combustion characteristics of SAF and JET A-1 fuels, focusing on parameters such as smoke point, ignition delay, ignition temperature, flame temperature, and heat release rate. This review describes the gaseous (CO2, CO, SOx and NOx) and particulate emissions from burning sustainable and fossil jet fuel. This study has advanced the understanding of renewable fuel properties and quality, supporting the development of sustainable fuel alternatives. Compliance with ASTM D1655-23 and ASTM D7566-23b standards is critical for the acceptance of SAF as a viable energy source in aviation transport. This study also describes the effect of particle emissions from JET fuels combustion on human health and air quality. Studies show that 100% SAFs are cleaner and pose fewer health risks than fossil Jet A-1. However, no ASTM certification is available for 100% drop-in SAF for commercial aviation. Future research should investigate how SAF blends with more than 50% SAF mixed with Jet A-1 burn and the emissions produced, and explore newer sources for SAF, such as microalgae, switchgrass, and sugarcane bagasse. This research will support the certification of higher SAF blends, accelerating the transition to more sustainable air travel. Investigating novel feedstocks is essential for expanding the availability and sustainability of SAFs, helping to diversify supply chains and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.",

        "The advent of cloud computing has provided people around the world with unprecedented access to computational power and enabled rapid growth in technologies such as machine learning, the computational demands of which incur a high energy cost and a commensurate carbon footprint. As a result, recent scholarship has called for better estimates of the greenhouse gas impact of AI: data scientists today do not have easy or reliable access to measurements of this information, which precludes development of actionable tactics. We argue that cloud providers presenting information about software carbon intensity to users is a fundamental stepping stone towards minimizing emissions. In this paper, we provide a framework for measuring software carbon intensity, and propose to measure operational carbon emissions by using location-based and time-specific marginal emissions data per energy unit. We provide measurements of operational software carbon intensity for a set of modern models covering natural language processing and computer vision applications, and a wide range of model sizes, including pretraining of a 6.1 billion parameter language model. We then evaluate a suite of approaches for reducing emissions on the Microsoft Azure cloud compute platform: using cloud instances in different geographic regions, using cloud instances at different times of day, and dynamically pausing cloud instances when the marginal carbon intensity is above a certain threshold. We confirm previous results that the geographic region of the data center plays a significant role in the carbon intensity for a given cloud instance, and find that choosing an appropriate region can have the largest operational emissions reduction impact. We also present new results showing that the time of day has meaningful impact on operational software carbon intensity.Finally, we conclude with recommendations for how machine learning practitioners can use software carbon intensity information to reduce environmental impact.",
        "In order to reduce carbon emissions and maintain economic development in the power industry of China, the improvement of electric carbon productivity (ECP) creates more efficiency. The carbon emission estimation in the power industry is significant to the ECP calculation in this study. Thus, to make the ECP calculation more reasonable and fair, this study estimates carbon emissions from the power industry by the consumption-based accounting principle considering power transfers among the provinces. In addition, this research analyzes seven driving factors of ECP change in China by exploring the time series decomposition (2003â€“2015) from the power consumption perspective. The Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method takes the regional and departmental dimensions into consideration. By applying the data from 30 provinces (including province-level municipalities) and three industrial sectors between 2010 and 2015, the influencing factors of ECP in each province and each industrial sector are discussed. The results show that: 1) Regional and industrial sector ECP, per capita GDP are the driving factors of increasing ECP; conversely, environmental efficiency of power consumption, industrial structure effect from the perspective of power consumption, economic efficiency effect of power consumption, and the ratio of total population to electric CO2 emissions play leading roles in the decline of ECP. 2) From 2003 to 2015, there are four distinct stages of the ECP changes. 3) The sub-regional decomposition indicates, during 2010â€“2015, the main power exporters have higher or medium level ECP, and the main power importers with rapid economic development manifest lower or medium level ECP. 4) Instead of solely focusing on GDP, the Chinese government should pay more attention to increasing the economic and environmental efficiency of power utilization. 5) The sub-sector decomposition shows, during 2010â€“2015, although the economic and environmental efficiency of power utilization are negative in the secondary industry, they are the greatest among the three industrial sectors, and the influence of the economic scale effect is stronger than that of technological impact on different industrial sectors. Finally, several conclusions are obtained which might be useful for the central and local governments to improve the national and regional ECPs.",
        "We consider a supply chain consisting of a supplier and a manufacturer under the carbon emission cap-and-trade scheme, where the manufacturer faces yield uncertainty. A Stackelberg model is adopted to investigate the production, price and carbon emission reduction decisions for the decentralized and centralized supply chain. We analyze the popular quantity discount contract and the revenue sharing contract for the supply chain. Our results indicate that the quantity discount contract can efficiently coordinate the low-carbon supply chain, but the revenue-sharing contract cannot. We then design a new contract of revenue-sharing with subsidy on emission reduction (RSS) to coordinate the supply chain. We have showed that the proposed RSS contract can coordinate the low-carbon supply chain with yield uncertainty perfectly and the carbon emission reduction level can achieve the level under the centralized case.",
        "This study was developed according to a two-step approach. In the first step, we provide an investigation of the changes in eco-efficiency under constant and variable return to scale, while on a second step the evaluation of the decoupling elasticity will be given. The impacts of energy, economic and environmental determinants (inputs) on the performance indicators of eco-efficiency were calculated as the inverse of the carbon intensity (ratio of the GDP over the CO2 emissions, both from the World Development Indicators database), the changes in eco-efficiency and the decoupling elasticity between CO2 emissions, and economic growth changes. Data was used for 16 Latin America countries, according to five-year periods, from 1994 to 2013. For all the five-time span considered, it is worth noting, that the degree of technical efficiency for the Latin America countries is lower than the degree of technological efficiency, thus indicating that a portion of the overall inefficiency is due to the fact that these countries are producing below the production frontier rather than to an inefficient use of technology. On average, the results have confirmed that the technological scale change in energy production is the dominant factor influencing the optimal production frontier in the sample of countries under analysis. Complementarily, according to the mixed results from the decoupling analysis, we may conclude that the increase/decrease of the CO2 per capita emissions was due to other economic and environmental factors rather than to a negative/positive effect of the GDP growth rate.",
        "As a core component of the emission trading scheme (ETS), the initial allocation of carbon quotas is extremely important. Currently, most allocation methods mainly focus on the realization of a single performance goal, which will result in conflicts between different levels of participants. To overcome this limitation, a bi-objective programming model (BPM) with two sub-objective functions of abatement costs and carbon assets is proposed. Meanwhile, cost-oriented model (CM) and asset-oriented model (AM) are implemented as comparison approaches that represent the minimization of regional abatement costs and the maximization of individual interests, respectively. The empirical results of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region reveal that BPM is the most efficient and feasible approach to some extent. More precisely, BPM can motivate the enthusiasm of all participants while optimizing abatement costs. With the increase of regional total quotas, the advantage of BPM becomes more and more prominent. The contribution of this paper is to present a novel method for carbon emission quota allocation, which fills the gap in the existing literature. Furthermore, the proposed method that can be deployed in other similar regions assists policymakers in enacting an effective emission reduction policy and in better understanding the objectives of economy, energy and environment.",
        "Among biomass energy technologies which are treated as the promising way to mitigate critical energy crisis and global climate change, biomass gasification plays a key role given to its gaseous fuels especially syngas for distributed power plant. However, a system analysis for the energy saving and greenhouse gas emissions abatement potentials of gasification system has been directed few attentions. This study presents a system analysis that combines process and input-output analyses of GHG emissions and energy costs throughout the full chain of activities associated with biomass gasification. Incorporating agricultural production, industrial process and wastewater treatment which is always ignored, the energy inputs in life cycle are accounted for the first commercial biomass gasification power plant in China. Results show that the non-renewable energy cost and GHG emission intensity of the biomass gasification system are 0.163â€¯MJ/MJ and 0.137â€¯kg CO2-eq/MJ respectively, which reaffirm its advantages over coal-fired power plants in clean energy and environmental terms. Compared with other biomass energy processes, gasification performs well as its non-renewable energy cost and CO2 intensity are in the central ranges of those for all of these technologies. Construction of the plant is an important factor in the process's non-renewable energy consumption, contributing about 44.48% of total energy use. Wastewater treatment is the main contributor to GHG emissions. The biomass gasification and associated wastewater treatment technologies have critical influence on the sustainability and renewability of biomass gasification. The results provide comprehensive analysis for biomass gasification performance and technology improvement potential in regulating biomass development policies for aiming to achieve sustainability globally.",
        "The mounting environmental crisis, especially the large-scale and continuous haze pollution, is the most pressing challenge for China during rapid urbanization process. This study is aimed at examining the relationship between haze pollution and economic growth, and its turning points for different regions in China based on the panel data of 27 capital cities and municipalities in China during 2011â€“2015. We constructed the parameter estimation model after conducting the unit root, cointegration and Hausman tests. Based on the basic and extended models, we find that the relationship between haze pollution and economic growth in China is not a typical inverted U-shaped Environmental Kuznet Curve (EKC). By introducing variables such as industrial structure, foreign trade, and energy intensity, this study demonstrates that adjusting industrial structure and improving energy efficiency are effective means for haze pollution control. Grouping regressions reveal that regional differences exist in the relationships between haze pollution and economic growth and their tuning points. For instance, there was a U shaped relationship for the central region, while there were inverted N shaped relationships for eastern, western, and northeastern regions. Policy implications are thus summarized for different regions in terms of balancing economic growth and environmental protection.",
        "Oceangoing ships carry approximately 80% of the world's traded goods by volume, which translates into more than 10 billion tonnes in shipped traded volumes per year (UNCTAD, 2017). Despite its importance, the maritime shipping sector has been traditionally overlooked in climate mitigation discussions, since this sector was largely neglected in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Key barriers for successful implementation of CO2 abatement measures in the sector include the lack of reliable emissions data and the inherent difficulty of attributing responsibility for international shipping emissions to the involved countries, companies and commodities, as well as the threat to global trade interests. We argue that the data paucity on maritime emissions from international trade can be addressed by linking and integrating a large wealth of data, previously used in isolation. By linking per vessel cargo composition data, individual vessel journeys from the Automatic Identification System and a bottom-up methodology to estimate emissions, using vessel specifications and details on their movements and operations, this paper describes and demonstrates this new approach for the case of Brazil's shipping manifests in 2014. We find that the maritime transportation associated with these trades is responsible for 25.99 million tonnes of CO2, an addition of 5% to Brazil's total CO2 emissions of 2014 (reported by the World Bank, currently excluding international shipping and aviation). We discuss the contribution of all traded commodities, as well as the role of the first destination ports and countries. The voyage- and commodity-specificity of this method allows us to showcase those commodities and trading routes which contribute the most towards this emissions account, in relation to those that are most valuable to Brazil's economy. We go on to discuss the implications of scaling up this methodology for global greenhouse gas abatement efforts and demand-side footprint calculations, as well as to improve accountability mechanisms for the maritime sector as a whole",
        "Several countries and cities have developed policies on zero carbon emission building or the alike as a driver for achieving sustainable development, which however mainly target houses and low-rise buildings. High-rise buildings in high-density urban built areas are generally perceived impossible to achieve zero carbon emission, and remain as a gap in policy study. Nevertheless, given the continuous rapid urbanisation, building higher and denser becomes the norm for many cities due to scarce developable land resources. This paper aims to develop and verify a dialectical system framework of zero carbon emission building policy for high-rise high-density cities focused on Hong Kong which is a typical high-density metropolis with the largest number of high-rise buildings in the world. The research was conducted through a questionnaire survey, follow-up interviews and focus group meetings, which together engaged over one thousand professionals and stakeholders selected using clustered and random sampling. The developed framework emphasises the interdependency between the technical elements of the policy within their complex and interactive socio-economic, geographical, and regulatory and political boundaries. For the technical elements, the zero carbon emission targets and timelines for Hong Kong were perceived very ambitious but can prioritise new public non-residential buildings. User behaviour and energy efficiency were considered critical given the limited renewables in the city. The boundaries of the policy should be clearly defined to address different contexts and stakeholders. A strong need was identified for formulating zero carbon emission building policy for Hong Kong, which however was perceived difficult to implement. The identified strategies should inform the practice of reducing high-rise buildingsâ€™ carbon emissions and thus achieving urban sustainability. The findings verify zero carbon emission building policy as complex dialectical systems and provide useful learning for such policy development in high-density cities.",
        "The contradiction between economic growth and carbon emissions in China and India is the most prominent in the world. Both countries have faced tremendous pressures to curb carbon emissions, because they are major source of new added emission sources. Meanwhile, both countries have faced greater pressures to achieve industrialization and urbanization in order to eradicate poverty. Better understanding the decoupling status and its drivers can serve to develop effective policy to achieve economic growth without an increase in emission. This paper comparatively analyses the decoupling effect of the economic growth from the carbon emissions as well as its drivers during the period 1980â€“2014 in China and India. The Tapio decoupling model was used to analyze the decoupling status, and the co-integration theory and the impulse response functions were applied to investigate the effects of urbanization, industrialization, per capita GDP and carbon emission intensity to decoupling. The results show that China mainly performed a weak decoupling of economic growth from carbon emissions in 1980â€“2014, while the decoupling status of India was no regular. In China, carbon emission intensity is the biggest contributor of decoupling, followed by urbanization, per capita GDP, and industrialization. In India, the biggest driver of decoupling is also the carbon emission intensity, followed by urbanization, industrialization, and per capita GDP. Therefore, improving energy efficiency is the best policy to toward economic growth without emission growth in China and India.",
        "The power sector contributes 40% of the carbon emission in China, so decreasing the carbon intensity of the power sector is crucial for China to achieve the mitigation target contained in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). Renewable electricity subsidy and carbon pricing are two commonly used mitigation policy instruments in the power sector, but their implementation costs are different. In this article, the Regional Generation Cost Evaluation Model (RGCEM), which is based on an electrical engineering model, Unit Commitment Model, is developed to analyze the emission reduction potential, implementation cost as well as the potential impact on the direct cost of electricity generation of both of the above mentioned policy instruments. Actual power generator data and a typical daily load curve of Guangdong Province, China are used to demonstrate the possible impacts of implementing renewable electricity subsidy and carbon pricing policies. The analysis shows that the emission reduction achieved by carbon price increase of 9.5â€“11.6 Yuan RMB/tCO2 is the same as that achieved by 1% increase of share of renewable electricity in the total electricity generation. The stricter the carbon intensity reduction target is, the higher carbon price increases are needed for substituting 1% increase of share of renewable electricity to achieve the same mitigation. The adjustment of mitigation policy portfolio will change the corresponding implementation costs of achieving the specific emission reduction target. It shall however be noted that the spillover effects of renewable electricity subsidy and carbon pricing are different, so implementation cost should not be the sole determinant for choosing mitigation policy instrument in the power sector.",
        "The adoption of electric vehicles is key to lowering the consumption of fossil fuels and emission of greenhouse gases. Cross-national surveys studying citizens' purchase intentions regarding electric vehicles (EVs) remain limited, especially when it comes to combining individual micro-level factors and contextual macro-level forces. Based on a cross-national dataset with 2806 respondents from China (nâ€¯=â€¯1078), Brazil (nâ€¯=â€¯929), and Russia (nâ€¯=â€¯799), this study analyzes variations and determinants of purchase intentions for EVs in these three countries. The survey results indicate that purchase intentions for EVs among Chinese citizens is higher than amongst Brazilian and Russian citizens. The purchasing intention of citizens in all three countries is especially high for people who have a wide social network, and if they already know somebody with an EV. Other macro-level factors, including pollution and charging infrastructure, only impact on purchasing intention in Brazil, while government policy initiatives for EVs seem to have limited effects in all three countries. Micro-level factors, such as age and education, do not have any statistically significant effect in Russia and Brazil, and only a weak effect in China. Based on these results, we provide recommendations for business and policy makers who need to anticipate citizens' demand for EVs and design policies suitable to accelerate the adoption of sustainable transport solutions.",
        "Several countries and cities have developed policies on zero carbon emission building or the alike as a driver for achieving sustainable development, which however mainly target houses and low-rise buildings. High-rise buildings in high-density urban built areas are generally perceived impossible to achieve zero carbon emission, and remain as a gap in policy study. Nevertheless, given the continuous rapid urbanisation, building higher and denser becomes the norm for many cities due to scarce developable land resources. This paper aims to develop and verify a dialectical system framework of zero carbon emission building policy for high-rise high-density cities focused on Hong Kong which is a typical high-density metropolis with the largest number of high-rise buildings in the world. The research was conducted through a questionnaire survey, follow-up interviews and focus group meetings, which together engaged over one thousand professionals and stakeholders selected using clustered and random sampling.

        "Renewable energy plays a significant role in climate change mitigation and energy transition. China has established demonstration cities for energy transition and renewable energy development. However, the assessment system for these implementations is relatively blank. This study develops an index system to guide the construction of energy transition demonstration project and optimize energy transition development at the city level. The genetic algorithm-based analytic hierarchy process is employed to form energy transition strategies in the cities of Guiyang, Tongren, Zhangjiakou, and Nanning. The priority values of different renewable energy technologies are given for the cities. The results show that resource endowment is not the only driver for the priority due to the unique combination of influence factors in decision. The assessment system can help avoid the problems of single operating mode and over-investment in the process of energy transition so as to find the benchmark for energy structure adjustment. Finally, some policy recommendations are made for city-scale energy transition.",
        "The objective of this paper is to serve as a decision aid for energy security policies and programmes in the context of a low carbon energy transition in South Africa. A concept-to-design prototyping matrix for energy security planning inclusive of energy services is presented. It is recommended that energy security design and planning frameworks should be self-defined and government accepted at the country level to be effective for sustainable energy development. The tension between energy security and energy transition is identified as a systemic risk and the concept of a meta-indicator is introduced to measure this transition gap which is modelled along an adaptive frontier. Complexity is explored as one of the three hallmarks of risk, as well as in its contribution to measurement challenges. A multi-scale, multi-speed heuristic model of a socio-energy system transition is illustrated and indicative South African energy supply and demand baselines and risk indicators are measured. The ratio of useful exergy output to final energy input (25%) is advanced as the efficiency indicator â€œclosestâ€ and â€œearliestâ€ to energy services, and a transdisciplinary monitoring and evaluation framework centred on jumping indicators is proposed for strategic monitoring and evaluative learning. Adaptive programmes are recommended because they are antifragile, and the concept of a resilience boundary is introduced for further development. A specific planning and monitoring tool is proffered together with other methodological options for future needs based applications.",
        "Large amount of energy is consumed to meet user satisfaction in public buildings, which causes carbon emission and results in environmental problem. A direct method to reduce this carbon emission is restricting opening area in public buildings. However, restricting opening area causes occupant satisfaction reduction. Trade-off carbon emission and occupant satisfaction needs to be concerned in building operation strategy design. In this paper, we developed a new integrated modelling method to trade-off between the carbon emission and occupant satisfaction of restriction strategies. We designed a case study in the sixth teaching building (STB) in Tsinghua University. Survey and field investigation were conducted to obtain data and build model. Integrated model result showed that satisfaction increases with the increase of carbon emission, while there exists cluster division and marginal diminishing patterns. By analyzing the performance of strategies with different calculation methods, we found that most optimal strategies open section B and C in STB. Meanwhile, when occupant number is 1,000, 2000 and 4,000, corresponding average satisfaction is 71.4%, 58.8% and 40.4%. It indicates that optimal operation strategy performance changes with the increase of occupant number, but the fluctuation is relatively mild. This integrated model has prospect in guiding energy conservation operation strategy design. It also supports real time monitoring and has potential in interactive platform application.",
        "The recent growth in U.S. natural gas reserves has led to interest in exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) to countries in Asia, Europe and Latin America. Here, we estimate the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and life cycle freshwater consumption associated with exporting Marcellus shale gas as LNG for power generation in different import markets. The well-to-wire analysis relies on operations data for gas production, processing, transmission, and regasification, while also accounting for the latest measurements of fugitive CH4 emissions from U.S. natural gas activities. To estimate GHG emissions from a typical U.S. liquefaction facility, we use a bottom-up process model that can evaluate the impact of gas composition, technology choices for gas treatment and on-site power generation on overall facility GHG emissions. For LNG exports to Mumbai, India for power generation in a combined cycle power plant with 50% efficiency, the base case life cycle GHG emissions, freshwater consumption, and CH4 emissions as fraction of gross gas production are estimated to be 473â€¯kg CO2eq/MWh (80% confidence interval: 452â€“503â€¯kg CO2eq/MWh), 243 gal/MWh (80% CI: 200â€“300 gal/MWh) and 1.2% (80% CI: 0.81â€“1.79%), respectively. Among all destinations considered, typical life cycle GHG emissions range from 459â€¯kg CO2eq/MWh to 473â€¯kg CO2eq/MWh, with GHG emissions from liquefaction, shipping and regasification contributing 7â€“10% of life cycle GHG emissions",
        "Energy recovery is one of the most important ways to clean production and reduce of carbon dioxide emission. Therefore, in this paper, a trigeneration system (combined cooling, heating and power or CCHP) is suggested to reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emission for building applications. The system consists of two beta-type Stirling engines as prime movers, a heat recovery system, an absorption chiller, and a power generator. The Stirling engine has been modeled based on a non-ideal adiabatic analysis in which the frictional and thermal losses of the engine have been considered using a developed numerical code. For model validation, the specifications of the GPU-3 Stirling engine have been used and the results have been compared with the experimental data and previous models. Moreover, the energy modeling of the absorption chiller has been performed using Stirling engine waste heat. Then, the effects of engine rotational speed, wall temperature of heater, and regenerator length on efficiency, fuel consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions reduction have been studied and the appropriate values have been presented. The results show that in these conditions, the appropriate values for the electrical efficiency and trigeneration efficiency are 27.31% and 74%, respectively. Furthermore, the fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission of this system have been encountered with reduction of 31.83% and 38.44% in comparison with conventional energy systems for buildings of the same conditions.",
        "Human activities cause massive CO2 emission, and the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) is currently one of the most effective methods of emission reduction. Few studies focus on the impact of different transfer payments in ETS on rural and urban population. This paper establishes a dynamic recursive Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model and constructs 3 counter-measure scenarios (i.e. payment methods based on income, direct tax and population, respectively), following China's pilot ETS pattern, to analyze and provide insights on the best option for the government to transfer ETS revenues to rural and urban population. The results show that commodity consumption, energy consumption, direct tax, and social welfare will be significantly impacted by ETS transfer payments, while commodity price and household savings will be less affected. For rural population, more transfer payments will lead to an increase in consumption levels in the ETS transfer payments scenario based on population, despite the rise in commodity prices. Moreover, the payments based on population can also reduce by 15.09 billion tons of CO2 emission during 2017â€“2030. Therefore, this paper suggests that the ETS transfer payments method should be based on population.",
        "China's recent rapid socioeconomic development has caused its land use patterns to evolve rapidly. Land use changes are significantly influencing carbon emissions in China. Thus, assessing carbon emissions from land use change patterns is significant for sustainable socioeconomic and ecological development. This study applied a geographic information system and data envelopment analysis (DEA) to estimate provincial-level carbon emission efficiency in China during 1999â€“2014. The results indicate that China's total carbon emissions and carbon sequestration from land use showed annual rising trends but with an increasing difference in growth. At provincial level, the highest provincial emissions were 3â€“4 times greater than the lowest. In addition, carbon sources increased 20 times faster than carbon sinks. The contribution of carbon emissions from construction land to total carbon emissions was greater than 90%, also, the contribution of carbon sinks from forest land to total carbon sinks was greater than 90%; Carbon emissions were most intensive in Northeast China, and they gradually decreased in a radiating pattern to the north, west, and south. Among 31 provinces, only Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Yunnan, Guangxi, and Heilongjiang showed effective reductions in carbon emissions. The spatial disparities in carbon emissions were likely due to differences in technological efficiency and scale of operation.",
        "The objective of traditional fleet optimization models has been to find the economic life of the assets, neglecting their environmental impacts. However, due to the effect of carbon pricing schemes, in addition to the international concerns about global warming and carbon emissions, it is essential for affected fleet owners to incorporate environmental burdens into their asset management systems. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, a fleet optimization model is proposed, which factors in the environmental impacts of a fleet of assets over a finite horizon, in addition to its total cost of ownership. As an indicator of environmental impacts, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the fleet ownership is considered. GHG emissions are converted into a monetary value, using the expected price of carbon in the Western Climate Initiative (WCI) market. Thus, the second contribution of this study is to develop a model to predict the price of carbon in this market. The optimization model is then applied to a fleet of excavators located in Ontario, Canada, and the price of carbon in the WCI market is forecasted over the planning horizon of the optimization model.",
        "A novel Carbon Dioxide Utilization (CDU) approach from a relatively minor biogenic carbon dioxide emission source, Rumen Fermentation Processes (RFP), is presented. The CO 2 -RFP strategy explores the potential treatment of the liquid manure storage located at the bottom of the dairy barns with CO2-enriched air coming from cattle exhalation and belching to produce an important fertilizer such as NH4HCO3 (ABC, ammonium bicarbonate). The unusual CDU strategy, analyzed exclusively from a chemical point of view, could yield over 31.6 Million of tones, Mt, of ABC in aqueous solution using c. 18.0â€¯Mt of CO2 and capturing c. 6.9â€¯Mt of NH3, ammonia. This process would consume less energy than the traditional synthetic method (ABC fertilizer process) and would not produce any by-products or chemical compounds which may enter into conflict with the dairy sector. The quantity of ABC obtained by this strategy would be equivalent to four times the world production per year. Taking into consideration only the most relevant dairy countries, the estimate of the CO2 negative emission achieved suggests a capture of around 1.8â€¯Gt of CO2 equivalents and 82.8â€¯Mt of NH3 from now to 2030. With the aim of providing a realistic outlook on the CO 2 -RFP strategy, the proposal is discussed considering a number of possible scenarios: the CO 2 -RFP strategy (1) in a typical livestock dairy farm, (2) in the most relevant dairy countries and (3) as a N-fertilizer supplier.",
        "Carbon emissions trading is one of the important economic means to solve the environmental externality. Based on the data of CO2 emissions from the thermal power plants over the period from 2005 to 2010 in China, this paper uses no-parametric optimization models to estimate the potential economic gains and potential carbon emissions reduction under three allocation strategies of carbon emissions trading allowance. Results show that the maximum potential gains can be obtained by the spatial allocation scenario for the combination of CO2-SO2 emissions trading, and the output growth ratio among power plants varies huge. The establishment of jointed CO2-SO2 emissions trading is usually highly beneficial to achieve the three targets, including the optimal allocation of resources, the increase of potential gains and the reduction of pollutant emissions.",
        "This paper investigates the issue of remanufacturing in a dual-channel supply chain. The manufacturer can produce/remanufacture the products and sell them at the same price through his own direct channel or a retail channel. Based on the cap-and-trade regulation, we construct two models with and without remanufacturing to obtain the optimal levels of carbon emission reduction and pricing strategies. The results indicate that remanufacturing can effectively improve the level of carbon emission reduction, and it is profitable to the manufacturer and the retailer. Furthermore, with remanufacturing, we investigate the effect of product promotion where the manufacturer can promote via direct channel (manufacturer's promotion), and the retailer can promote via retail channel (retailer's promotion). With the manufacturer's promotion, the results show that both the level of carbon emission reduction and profit of the manufacturer increase, but the retailer's profit decreases. On the other hand, the retailer's promotion can improve the profits of the retailer and the manufacturer when more consumers prefer the retail channel. Finally, we provide more managerial insights in the sensitivity analysis and extension parts.",
        "To clarify the spatial characteristics of CO2 emissions, economic externalities of spatial units are transplanted into CO2 emissions research. Furthermore, to identify emissions reduction pathways, spatial econometric models are constructed based on the patent data about energy conservation and emissions reduction. The key results are: (1) The kernel density plot of China's CO2 emissions shows an obvious right-averse state, and the peak is getting lower. Therefore, we can conclude that CO2 emissions in China are increasing, and polarisation of CO2 emissions is serious; (2) Due to the similarity and connectivity exist in spatial units, China's CO2 emissions have shown a stable spatial agglomeration effect from global and local perspectives; (3) Based on adjacent, geographic, and economic distance matrices, energy technological progress has played a positive emissions reduction role on China's CO2 emissions from the perspective patent data about energy saving and emissions reduction. Finally, on the basis of the above conclusions, some policy implications have been proposed accordingly.",
        "Due to the increase in environmental awareness and stringent government regulations, companies are paying closer attention to producing consumer goods with low carbon emissions. In many cases, the production operations of these products are outsourced to independently owned manufacturers in the corresponding supply chains. This paper proposes a new decision framework to use in a decentralized decision making environment that evaluates the tradeoffs between the total costs and the carbon emission occurred during the extraction of the material, the production operations and assembly, and the required transportation. Under the proposed framework, the product designer decides the preliminary design options and amount of carbon rebate, and the manufacturer optimizes its supply chain decisions according to the design and amount of carbon rebate. The supply chain optimization problem is formulated and solved by dynamic programming. The problem is complex for three reasons. First, the problem has dual objectives: cost and carbon emission. Second, there are several options to reduce carbon emission. Third, the product design requirement imposes constraints on the feasibility and efficiency of these options. We develop graphical tools to help product designers identify the set of Pareto-efficient options and illustrate the tradeoffs. A real-world table lamp manufacturing case illustrates how to use the proposed framework including the sequence of decisions, the information required, and the interpretations of the graphical tools.",
        "Climate policy objectives require zero emissions across all sectors including steelmaking. The fundamental process changes needed for reaching this target are yet relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose and assess a potential design for a fossil-free steelmaking process based on direct reduction of iron ore with hydrogen. We show that hydrogen direct reduction steelmaking needs 3.48â€¯MWh of electricity per tonne of liquid steel, mainly for the electrolyser hydrogen production. If renewable electricity is used the process will have essentially zero emissions. Total production costs are in the range of 361â€“640 EUR per tonne of steel, and are highly sensitive to the electricity price and the amount of scrap used. Hydrogen direct reduction becomes cost competitive with an integrated steel plant at a carbon price of 34â€“68 EUR per tonne CO2 and electricity costs of 40 EUR/MWh. A key feature of the process is flexibility in production and electricity demand, which allows for grid balancing through storage of hydrogen and hot-briquetted iron, or variations in the share of scrap used.",
        "Heavy duty vehicles (HDVs), such as those used for winter services (e.g. snow plowing), are responsible for around 25% of CO2 emissions caused by road transportation, which is also a challenge of energy resources. In this paper an optimization approach developed for the fleet management of winter services is presented, which was also evaluated in city of Maribor, Slovenia. The algorithm used is based on a mathematical graph theory, specifically on a solution to the Chinese postman problem, using two types of optimization: 1) optimization of the entire plan of the winter service and 2) optimization of the completed part of the planned service. The winter service includes plowing and a salting process that requires refilling the salt reservoirs on the vehicles. In our real-world case only one base was available for refilling the salt reservoirs, so two additional optimization approaches were evaluated: a) optimization of the traversals of plans starting form a single base and b) using proposed three additional recharge bases distributed across the city and recharging at the closest base when needed. The results of the optimization suggested a reduction of route length by 28.3% when executing the entire plan. When considering a redistribution of the salting material at three other locations, our estimation has showed that additional savings up to 9.8% could be achieved regarding to the selection of those locations. Less routes traveled consequently leads to a reduction of resource usage (diesel) and lower CO2 emissions. When executing 15 plans in a single winter service campaign, 210â€¯L less diesel was used, resulting in 1.362â€¯t less CO2 emissions per campaign, representing a reduction of 30%. Our model was initially based on real-life snow plowing processes and their statistics; where possible we used real-life data to configure the model, such as the salting material, loading times, the quantity of salting material distributed per km, the characteristics of the plowing vehicle, etc. Due to the heavy conditions during the execution of planned winter services, plans sometimes had to be readjusted on the go. Combining optimization with custom software for real-time execution, planning and service monitoring, assisted from the cloud, provided even more deterministic cost and environmental management, and gave further opportunity for optimization processes.",
        "The Paris Agreement highlighted that pathways towards a future with fossil fuel independent societies require the transformation of all sectors to reduce the levels of greenhouse gasses emissions. To this end the industry sector, characterised by a high share of emissions and an intense and diversified energy demand, holds a paramount role. In the framework of assessing the transformation of the industry sector towards more sustainable alternatives, due to interdependencies within an energy system, the adoption of measures to reduce fossil fuel use in industry (e.g. efficiency, fuel substitution, electrification and energy cascading) can influence the operation and transformation of the energy system. To this end, the study proposes a method to simulate and optimise operational aspects of the industry sector at high level of details. The conceptual model is then integrated in an established bottom-up energy system model, creating a benchmark for analyses that can focus simultaneously on the impact of changes in the industry and in the energy sector on a system wide scale. On the practical side, by mean of a Danish case study, the paper sheds light on particular characteristics of the industry sectors, focusing on the structure of industrial energy use in regards to end-use processes, aspects of energy consumption, and measures for fossil fuel reduction. Considerations sparking from the analysis show the potential applicability of energy cascading, electrification and fuel substitution for industrial processes, engaging elements and technologies interlinked within the energy system. Given the theoretical approach proposed, similar considerations can be investigated for other case studies, exploiting the simultaneous optimisation of power, district heat, industry dispatches and characteristics. In this framework, the transformation of the energy use in industry sector can be simulated according to more stringent policies capping C O 2 emission levels and specific support schemes, paving the way for carbon neutral societies and a more sustainable, yet resilient, future energy system.",
        "ine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations are mainly influenced by human activities and natural conditions, yet how these impacts are driven under these two circumstances is not well understood. Identifying the spatial characteristics and the potential determinants of PM2.5 variations from the joint perspectives, can provide insights into particulate pollution control. Due to the limited observations for PM2.5, here a timely structure adaptive modeling method was employed in order to estimate PM2.5 concentration levels in China in 2014. Then global and local regression approaches were combined in order to identify the joint impacts of natural conditions (elevation, vegetation, precipitation, and temperature) and eight anthropogenic factors (including urban sprawl and economic structure) on PM2.5 concentrations. Results indicated an annual mean concentration of 69.7â€¯Î¼g/m3 of PM2.5 in China, with significant differences being observed across space. More than 70% of Chinese cities were found to exceed Grade II of the Chinese National Ambient Air Quality Standard, with the highest levels in the Sichuan Basin and the North China Plain. Global regression results, showing the relative influence of the twelve factors on variations in PM2.5 levels, indicate that elevation, vegetation, precipitation, temperature, and per capita GDP all have potentially offsetting effects in relation to increasing PM2.5 levels that are being driven by industrial structure and energy-related carbon emissions. If China persists in its development pattern, industrialization and fossil energy consumption will inevitably increase a development which will lead to higher PM2.5 concentrations according to the results of the analysis. The geographically weighted regression results showed that the relationship between the factors studied and PM2.5 concentrations is spatially heterogeneous at the local geographic level. Elevation (77.3%) and urban sprawl (57.4%) had the most significant impacts on PM2.5 concentrations. Findings from this research can shed new light on the multiple mechanisms underlying spatial variations in PM2.5 throughout China and provide insights useful to particulate pollution control in China.",
        "Livestock production in peri-urban areas constitutes an important sub-sector of the agricultural production system in China, and contributes to environmental degradation and local air borne pollution contributing to smog. As a result, local policies are being implemented to safeguard the environment. However, there has been little attempt to quantify the impact of environmental policies on livestock production structure, spatial distribution and their related greenhouse gases (GHGs) and ammonia (NH3) emissions. Here, we calculated the inventories of GHGs and NH3 emissions for 2010 and 2014 for peri-urban livestock production in Beijing, using reliable spatially explicit data, which was collected from 1748 industrial farms in 2010 and 2351 industrial farms in 2014, including pig, dairy, beef cattle, poultry and sheep farms. Our estimates indicated that total industrial livestock production increased by 17% between 2010 and 2014, even under the more strict environmental protection polices, with farm size decreasing by between 7% and 47%. Up to 50% of the industrial livestock farms have remained in operation, with the rest closing down or being moved to other regions. Following this trend, total GHGs emission decreased from 5.0 to 4.5â€¯Tg CO2-eq between 2010 and 2014. Most of the GHGs emission reduction was due to the lowering of energy related carbon dioxide (CO2) emission in 2014. Total NH3 emission decreased from 102 to 96â€¯Gg between 2010 and 2014, mainly due to more stringent environmental regulations for new and extended farms (increased in farm size), e.g. Discharge standard for pollutants for livestock and poultry breeding. Our study identified that GHGs and NH3 emission hotspots were concentrated in suburban areas (around the city centre and with less agricultural resource and population density) in 2010. However, between 2010 and 2014 these hotspots moved to the exurban plain and mountain area following the closure or sub-division of intensive farms in suburban regions and construction of new and small farms in exurban areas (around the suburban and with more agricultural resource and lower population density). Scenario analysis suggests that total GHGs emission can be reduced by up to 1.0â€¯Tg CO2-eq (23% of total livestock sector emissions) in Beijing, using a combination of modifications of farm type, livestock diet and manure management. The integrated scenario can reduce CH4, N2O and NH3 emissions by 27%, 9% and 35%, compared to the reference scenario. Within this short period of time (5Â years), policies have had direct impacts on peri-urban livestock production in Beijing, resulting in marked changes in the structure of different livestock sectors, as well as the GHGs and NH3 emission inventories and their spatial distribution. Our analysis clearly shows that the success of these (and future) polices relies on optimizing spatial management of new livestock production systems. Policy and farmer guidance should focus on optimizing livestock diet and on-farm manure management, industrial production systems and the pig and poultry sectors in peri-urban regions.",
        "The inter-provincial inequality of per capita CO2 emissions in China's electricity sector means that their responsibilities for CO2 emission reduction are different. Considering the spatial separation of CO2 emissions in power production and consumption, with respect to the large scale inter-provincial electricity trade in China, this paper innovatively investigates the sub-national inequality and polarization degree of per capita CO2 emissions in China's electric power sector from the perspectives of both production and consumption. The overall tendencies of the sub-national polarization degrees of per capita CO2 emissions embodied in the both electric power consumption and production in China show an increasing trend. The results indicate that the polarization distribution of per capita CO2 emissions is still one of the important factors leading to difficulties in achieving the new reduction arrangements. The evolution of the bi-polarization analysis shows that the grouping results of per capita CO2 emissions are different from production and consumption perspectives, as well as the high- and low-emission groups have significantly different characteristics. The inequality and polarization degree of per capita CO2 emissions in China's electric power sector have changed as the CO2 emissions embodied in the electricity trade had been taken into account. One-Size-Fits-All Strategies are unlikely to be successful in advancing the provincial cooperation on CO2 emissions reduction.",
        "This paper provides a systematic analysis that identifies the driving forces of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of 286 Chinese prefecture-level cities in 2012. The regression analysis confirms the economic scale and structure effects on cities' CO2 emissions in China. If China's annual economic growth continues at the rate of 7%, CO2 emissions will increase by about 6% annually. In addition, climate conditions, urbanization and public investment in R&D are identified as important driving forces to increase the CO2 emissions of Chinese cities. While an increment of the urbanization rate by 1% increases the CO2 emissions by about 0.9%; An increase in R&D investment by 1% can help reduce CO2 emissions by 0.21%. As cities in our study vary greatly based on their industry composition, development stage and geographical location, the patterns of their CO2 emissions are also variable. Our study improves the comprehensiveness and accuracy of previous carbon accounting method by distinguishing the scope 1 and scope 2 CO2 emissions and establishing a high spatial resolution dataset of CO2 emissions (CHRED). The analysis covers almost all Chinese prefectural cities and derives useful implications for China's low carbon development.",
        "This study develops a dynamic integrated input-output simulation model to explore potential pathways towards GHG emission peak prior to 2030 for China. Dynamic energy consumption intensities and GHG emission intensities (GHGEIs) of sectors (household), as well as various levels of economic growth are set in 4 scenarios (each containing 4 sub-scenarios). The impacts of changes in the added value (reflected as industrial restructuring) and changes in GHGEIs (reflected as technological advancement and intensified policies) of 10 target sectors including both promoted and constrained ones on the peak are elaborated. In the Business-as-Usual scenario, no emission peak could appear before 2040 along the historical trends without taking further intensified emission reduction policies. In Scenario 1 and 2, when economic growth is maintained at higher levels, sole dependence on changes in either added value or GHGEIs of sectors could curb GHG emissions, however without contributing to a peak timing before 2030. The peak timing could be advanced to 2026 (10.85â€¯Ã—â€¯109â€¯t CO2-e), 2025 (10.77â€¯Ã—â€¯109â€¯t CO2-e), 2024 (10.69â€¯Ã—â€¯109â€¯t CO2-e) and 2023 (10.65â€¯Ã—â€¯109â€¯t CO2-e) corresponding to different levels of economic growth in Scenario 3, where industrial restructuring and intensified energy and GHG emission reduction policies are involved. The results are expected to provide references to future planning of energy utilization and GHG emission reduction from the perspective of both the country and sectors.",
        "Among the many possible strategies for reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is reduction of emissions associated with the production of concrete, which is responsible for 8â€“9% of global anthropognic GHG emissions. Using supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) in concrete to offset demand for clinker in cement is a commonly proposed method to cut GHG emissions from concrete production. The most commonly used SCMs are industrial byproducts, such as fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag, but the extent to which these SCMs should be used in individual concrete mixtures is not well examined. This research examines the contribution of fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag to compressive strength, the role of allocation in the assessment of environmental impacts, and the impacts of transportation. Quantitative analyses are developed using environmental impact assessments and comparisons are drawn based on changes in GHG emissions for concrete production. The findings of this research show that these three factors can outweigh benefits associated with use of SCMs: depending on SCM type and use of allocation or changes in transportation, high levels of SCM replacement do not consistently result in lower GHG emissions for the production of concrete per unit strength. Limited supplies of these popular byproduct SCMs amplifies the necessity to efficiently use these materials. Within the limitations of this study, this work shows strategic use of SCMs to cut GHG emissions based on regional availability and based on application should be a priority.",
        "Trucking activities in urban logistics networks (ULNs) are a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Diversified logistics demand leads to a variety of truck trip purpose, to study truck related emissions by trip purpose is necessary. This study aims to analyze the characteristics of trucking activities in a ULN by trip purpose and to investigate the relationships between trucks' trip emissions and critical influential factors from a ULN perspective, with a particularly focuses on the effects of the Euclidean distance of a trip, the vehicle curb weight, as well as the population density at a trip's origin/destination (OD). By combining a large set of empirical GPS trucking data and analytical information of ULN properties from Shenzhen, China, an imputation matrix approach is first developed to classify the truck data, based on trip purposes. Then, the trucking characteristics in terms of each trip purpose are extracted from the processed data. The GHG emissions associated with the trucking activities are estimated using a variant of the comprehensive modal emissions model (CMEM). A multivariate regression analysis is conducted to independently and quantitatively identify whether the critical factors vary in terms of a trip's purpose and to establish how such factors impact on GHG emissions. These results suggesting that designing emission management measures should take such purposes into consideration. The significant of OD Euclidean distance and the vehicle curb weight may vary by trip purpose, while the OD population density could also be regarded as an underlying determinant of most trip purposes. The results can be extended to other cities with similar classifications of trip purposes in their ULNs, thereby providing a decision-support tool for governmental policies and regulations, the locations of logistics facilities, and operational plans for trucks.",
        "Sustainable development efforts aimed at substantial reduction of carbon dioxide emissions focused research activities in this field, among others, on a partial or full replacement of Portland cement by environmental more friendly alternatives. Calcined gypsum can be considered as one of possible options in that respect. However, although the environmental impact is an important issue, gypsum was analyzed only rarely and sufficiently accurate data are still missing. In this paper, a carbon footprint analysis of two types of gypsum ranging from cradle to gate according to ISO 14067 is presented. The inventory data based on primary data obtained from the producers of natural gypsum and flue gas desulfurization gypsum in the Czech Republic are completed by the emission factors obtained from the literature survey. The results of the carbon footprint analysis show that the carbon dioxide emissions related to the manufacturing of calcined gypsum from flue gas desulfurization gypsum are 105.3â€¯kg of carbon dioxide/t, i.e., 25.2% lower than for the application of natural gypsum. Calcination is identified as the most harmful process from the point of view of carbon dioxide generation for both raw materials; it is responsible for 55% and 72% of total carbon dioxide emissions for natural gypsum and flue gas desulfurization gypsum, respectively. The obtained information is essential for further design and development of new types of composites meeting the requirements of sustainable development better than todayâ€™s mainstream solutions.",
        "To achieve the Chinese government's CO2 emissions reduction target and build a carbon trading market in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, an initial allocation of CO2 emissions quotas among cities in this region is fundamental. Different from the previous CO2 emissions quotas allocation methods, this paper uses the maximum deviation method (MDM) to allocate CO2 emissions quotas in the PRD region by taking the imbalanced development of different cities into consideration. Three principles including equality (represented by a population indicator), efficiency (represented by a GDP indicator) and feasibility (represented by a historical CO2 emissions indicator) are considered in the method. The results reveal that the allocations derived by the MDM are more balanced than those derived using either single indicator approach or the information entropy method, and more closer to the development targets of Guangdong province. The more balanced allocations will be conducive to stimulating the development of under-developed cities and narrowing the gap between developed and under-developed cities, thus help to achieve the sustainable development in the PRD region. This paper helps to enrich the emissions quotas allocation methods and provides a new equitable method for policy makers to allocate emissions quotas under imbalanced development circumstances.",
        "In the last years, food industries have sought to achieve more sustainable productions to meet the consumers' needs and limit the damages to the environment. The agri-food sector is one of the most impactful on the environment, due to resources depletion, land degradation and emissions. In Italy, one of the most important sectors in the agri-food industry is the tomato processing. Indeed, Italy is one of the world leading processed tomato producers, representing approximately 13% of the global production and 48% of European production. According to the latest data released by the National Association of the Canned Vegetables Industry (Anicav), Italy's processed tomato production totalled 5.1 million metric tons (MMT) in 2016. Among them, mashed tomato (â€œpassataâ€) represents about 50% of packaged tomato volumes in Italy. The aim of this work is to use a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach to make a â€œfrom cradle to graveâ€ analysis of this Italian processed product. In particular, the environmental performances of 500â€¯g mashed tomato packaged in Tetra PakÂ®, produced by a Southern Italy company, are studied. The uncertainty of the input parameters is taken into account and a Monte Carlo simulation is performed. All data are analyzed using SimaPro 8.4.0 software, adopting ReCiPe 1.12 method at midpoint and endpoint level. It is clear that both agricultural steps, processing steps and packaging materials' production generate relevant contributions to impact categories at midpoint and endpoint level. In particular, cultivation is the main contributor to the majority of midpoint categories. In order to identify, among the processing steps, the most affecting ones, an in-depth analysis is proposed. Among them, blanching, concentration and pasteurization steps are the main contributors to the emissions. A sensitivity analysis, considering the effect of the substitution of the energy sources, is conducted. Two improved scenarios are proposed to minimize the emissions at endpoint level, and it can be observed that the most promising solution, from the environmental point of view, would lead to a global reduction of 33.3% of the emissions affecting human health, ecosystem diversity and resource bioavailability.",
        "This paper investigates the environmental benefits of ride-sharing through its CO2 emission mitigation potential. Ride-sharing is expected to substantially decrease CO2 emissions by raising vehicle occupancy, thus mechanically reducing the number of vehicles on the road. Yet, as ride-sharing entails both a decrease in travel (monetary) costs and in travel times (inasmuch as it reduces road congestion), it is likely to make the car more attractive ultimately. This could result in mode switching in the short run (as travelers forsake public transport or active modes for car), as well as in longer distances travelled in the medium run. In the long run, people could even take advantage of the easier travel conditions to relocate further within the metropolitan area. To account for these rebound effects, we develop an integrated land-use transport model. This intends to capture the effects of ride-sharing on the whole household decision process regarding transport and residential location. The model is applied to the Paris region, with several ride-sharing scenarios for year 2030. While ride-sharing does indeed strongly reduce CO2 emissions, we find substantial rebound mechanisms. In contrast to the (naÃ¯ve) expectation that raising vehicle occupancy by 50% would reduce CO2 emissions by 33%, the various rebound effects end up dividing the CO2 emission savings by a factor ranging from 2 to 3 depending on the day period considered (i.e. the morning or evening peak period). The rebound mechanisms - the mode switching, distance and relocation effects - should therefore be heeded. Some policy recommendations are provided to develop ride-sharing while curbing these unintended effects.",
        "Five currently used methods to account for the global warming (GW) impact of the induced land-use change (LUC) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been applied to four biofuel case studies. Two of the investigated methods attempt to avoid the need of considering a definite occupation â€“thus amortizationâ€“ period by considering ongoing LUC trends as a dynamic baseline. This leads to the accounting of a small fraction (0.8%) of the related emissions from the assessed LUC, thus their validity is disputed. The comparison of methods and contrasting case studies illustrated the need of clearly distinguishing between the different time horizons involved in life cycle assessments (LCA) of land-demanding products like biofuels. Absent in ISO standards, and giving rise to several confusions, definitions for the following time horizons have been proposed: technological scope, inventory model, impact characterization, amortization/occupation, plantation lifetime and harvesting frequency. It is suggested that the anticipated technical lifetime of biorefineries using energy crops as feedstock stands as the best proxy for the cut-off criterion of land's occupation period and the inventory modeling period. Top-down LUC models are suggested as a gross reference benchmark to evaluate LUC results from bottom-up models, since the former represent average GHG emissions from deforestation statistics at different spatial resolutions. Reporting LUC emissions per area and implementing a corporate accounting system that ascribes deforestation emissions to responsible companies could avoid the critical uncertainty related to yield estimations.",

    
        "Energy is a basic issue for cleaner production and more sustainable consumption. A transition to renewable sources and massive energy savings face several problems: technological lock-ins, energy companies' oligopoly, unsteadily governments' policies. These problems are especially severe in small island developing states or regions. For these territories, however, energy transition can be a chance to improve their situation, especially if they are rich of renewable sources and they can mobilise important cultural and organisational resources, such as claims for identity and autonomy. An exemplary case study is Sardinia, the second biggest island in the Mediterranean Sea. It has problems of energy supply, strained political relationships with the mainland, and low economic development. The framework for this case study is rooted in multilevel perspective and political economy, complemented by games playing metaphor. The research hypothesis is that sustainable energy practices emerge if a variety of â€˜gamesâ€™ are visible, if they stimulate lay people participation, and if they are consistent with key goals for islanders, including independence, development and identity. In Sardinia, three games are identified: fossil fuels vs. renewables, competition on smart grid and storage system technologies, energy sovereignty vs. energy interdependency. There is not a single result of these games. Variable situations emerge, which allow forecasting a very slow progress of the energy transition.",
        "Energy rebound effect is a major issue in energy economics. Global energy and environmental problems have compelled the need for simultaneous attainment of economic development and energy conservation. Technological progress increases energy efficiency and saves energy, but it also causes energy rebound effect which discounts the expected energy conservation. China's transport sector is energy-intensive. Therefore, investigating rebound effect in China's transport sector has a very important significance for energy conservation and the formulation of related policies. Taking China's transport sector as a case study, we used translog production function to measure the contribution rate of technological progress to output growth, and estimated the rebound effect. The results show that the average rebound effect was about 68.3% during 1981â€“2015. Finally, we provided relevant policy recommendations on the rebound effect based on the characteristics of energy use in China's transport sector.",
        "Korea has the highest air pollution among the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Since the recent environmental analysis (Kim etÂ al., 2017) reported the feasibility of replacing taxis with electric vehicles (EVs) in metropolitan cities from a â€˜tank-to-wheelâ€™ emission perspective, various stakeholders have attempted to reduce air pollution by activating the EV market in Korea in accordance with international trends. Nevertheless, no holistic study has yet been published on the nationwide changes in air quality caused by EV diffusion from the perspective of â€˜well-to-wheelâ€™ emissions. This paper presents the results of estimating the stability of the electric power supply and fine particulate matter emissions in some cases, and the results of examining the structure of public discourse using big social media data. From the findings of our study, we made the following conclusions: (1) If the market share of EVs exceeds 12.5% before 2030 in Korea's domestic market, the supply and demand of stable energy will be threatened. (2) Under traditional energy mix conditions, the popularization of EVs may slightly reduce air pollution over metropolitan roads, but drastically increase air pollution near power plants that utilize fossil fuels. (3) Social media discussions show that the public is neither concerned about EVs being possible sources of pollutants, nor about potential instabilities in the energy market. (4) To obtain a socially acceptable energy mix, energy policy decision makers can select emission-free energy sources, such as nuclear power and renewable energy, depending on their priorities and based on power demand management to suppress excessive electrification.",
        "Establishing an energy monitoring and management methodology is a quintessential milestone for informed energy savings decision making as well as for effectively reducing the cost and the environmental impact of shipping operations. In this study, a novel systematic methodology is proposed for the energy management of the ship propulsion engine, which is the largest ship energy producer. The methodology employs a combination of tools including statistical analysis, compressor modelling to predict the engine airflow and energy and exergy analyses, whereas its output includes the engine operating profile, the most frequently occurring propeller curves and the engine most frequent operating points, the key performance indicators for quantitatively assessing the recorded parameters quality as well as the energy/exergy flows and the engine components exergy destruction. The methodology is implemented for three case studies for a very large crude carrier, a container ship and a bulk carrier, for which recorded data were available by using different monitoring techniques from either noon reports or automatic data acquisition systems. The derived results provide the engine operating profile demonstrating that the investigated vessels were operating in slow steaming conditions with a lower engine efficiency associated with a greater exhaust gas wasted energy. The measured data analysis demonstrates the better quality of the data recorded by automated monitoring systems and pinpoint maintenance issues of the engine components. Lastly, the exergy analysis results demonstrate that the exhaust gas and jacket cooling water provide the greater exergy flows rendering them attractive for energy saving initiatives, whereas the engine block, compressor and turbine are the engine components with the greater exergy destruction, thus requiring closer monitoring for timely identifying mitigating measures.",
        "The automobile industry is demanding new car components to reduce vehicle emissions and increase efficiency. Lightweighting strategies are the most followed by manufacturers to reduce the weight and fuel consumption of vehicles. In this study, an innovative signal cable solution for the wire harnesses of vehicle is analysed through a life cycle assessment (LCA) and benchmarked with the replaced cable. The innovative cable is made up of a copper-tin alloy, while the traditional cable is made of copper. Both products are twisted and insulated with plasticised polyvinyl chloride. The new cable reduces the weight and volume by 53% and 41%, respectively, compared to the traditional cable. The production of raw and ancillary materials was found to be the main impact contributor, mainly due to the production of the conductive and insulation materials. Similarly, electricity consumption was the main impact carrier for the manufacturing stage. The environmental burdens obtained for the innovative cable were, on average, 54% lower than those obtained for the replaced one. Additionally, the potential marginal gains for the automobile industry were evaluated in terms of fuel consumption reduction, which is linked to vehicle weight, and the derived emissions, obtaining a significant exhaust emission reduction of 160â€¯kg CO2 eq when compared to the baseline scenario. Finally, the LCA of these products was decisively influenced by the consumption of raw materials and, therefore, the reduction of the thickness of the wire makes the cables considerably more sustainable from an environmental point of view.",
        "Changes in consumer behavior due to a personal carbon trading (PCT) scheme are theoretically attractive, yet untested in practice. In this paper, simulations on the basis of an equilibrium model are used to examine the effects of carbon allowance prices on energy use choice under a particular PCT scheme. It is shown that the equilibrium price of allowances would emerge under the PCT scheme considered here. Further analyses indicate that the quantity of energy consumption under PCT is a nonlinear function of the allowance price, with a sharp kink at the point of equilibrium. When the allowance price is below the equilibrium price, consumers would prefer higher-carbon energy. In contrast, when the allowance price is above the equilibrium price, consumers would choose lower-carbon energy. However, when the allowance price equals the equilibrium value, consumers would purchase lower-carbon energy and higher-carbon energy simultaneously. Furthermore, it is shown that the initial allowance allocation could also affect energy use choice. On the basis of these results, one of the main implications is that the allowance price should exceed the breakeven price to stimulate consumers to switch to green energy and progressively live a low-carbon lifestyle.",
        "Urban environmental governance is critical for responding climate change. Existing policies have been inefficient for addressing complicated socio-ecological issues. In order to further promote related studies, it is critical to have a comprehensive review so that recent research progresses can be summarized and future research directions can be identified. Under such a circumstance, this paper aims to conduct a bibliometric review on urban environmental governance, with a focus on addressing climate change. Based on 1697 articles published from 1997 to 2017 and searched from Web of Science, a systematic method combining bibliometric analysis and network analysis is applied to uncover the dynamic trends, academic collaboration and research hotspots. Results show that the overall publication quantity had been gradually improved. The key journals include Journal of Cleaner Production, Sustainability and Energy Policy. Authors from USA have the most publications and international co-authorships, followed by China and UK, while the most influential institution is the Chinese Academy of Science. Moreover, research keywords have been identified, including GHG emission, energy, water, health and transport. In terms of research methods, life cycle assessment and ecological footprint are the dominating methods. In order to further improve research in this field, it is crucial to combine different methods so that more innovative perspectives can be presented. Research findings from this study can also provide valuable policy insights to policy-makers so that appropriate urban environmental governance policies can be raised to mitigate the overall greenhouse gas emission.",
        "As the world's largest energy consumer, China has set the dual goal of controlling both its total energy consumption and intensity in the 13th Five-Year Plan. As one of the most economically active types of regional units in China, urban agglomerations, composed of adjacent cities with close trade interlinks, play a vital role in energy consumption. Existing studies have provided empirical evidence of industrial transfer as a consequence of urban agglomerations, while a few have focused on whether such industrial transfers could promote the dual goal of controlling both total volume of energy consumption and intensity of all the cities within an urban agglomeration. To bring clarity to this issue, this paper attempts to measure industrial transfer and its impact on total energy consumption and intensity of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration by developing a multi-regional input-output model. The results indicate there is mutual industrial transfer between any two cities within the urban agglomeration. Consequently, total energy consumption has increased by 6258.78 thousand tons of standard coal equivalent while energy intensity has declined by 0.19 tons coal equivalent/thousand Yuan. Finally, a few policy recommendations about dual control of total energy consumption and intensity for urban agglomerations have been proposed. Our study enhances understanding of the critical role of industrial transfer in executing dual control of total energy consumption and energy intensity of urban agglomerations, thus assisting policymakers in finding ways to achieve sustainable urban transitions.",
        "Replacing virgin materials with recycled or sustainable materials to reduce energy consumptions and emissions is the focus of contemporary research to reduce building related emissions. Geopolymer concrete produced using 100% fly ash is a similar sustainable construction material capable of replacing Portland Cement (PC) concrete. As a replacement for PC, fly ash seems to be a sustainable solution, however the benefits from the production process of fly ash geopolymer (FAGP) concrete is the subject of considerable debate. In addition, factors such as local availability and transportation issues could potentially increase the emission profile of FAGP concrete. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the emission profiles for different types of fly ash in Australia considering availability and transportation. A case study and a scenario analysis are also presented to demonstrate the factors that affect the Green House Gas (GHG) emission profile of FAGP manufacture. The results indicate that to the GHG emission profile for FAGP concrete changes considerably based on the material availability, transportation and mix design. Alkali activators and elevated heat curing processes also significantly contribute the total GHG emissions of FAGP concrete production. The results further signify that the case study location could influence the employment of FAGP concrete in terms of GHG emissions. Further studies are encouraged on optimising the cost, GHG emissions, availability and strength characteristics to strike a balance between in sustainability for selecting the best FAGP type for construction. The results also provide the initial factors to be considered in developing a guideline for employing sustainable materials in the building industry.",
        "Flue gas denitration systems play an important role in reducing nitrogen oxide emissions. However, their potential resource efficiency, environmental impacts and economic performance should be emphasized. It is necessary to assess their effects from pros and cons so as to reflect their relatively sustainable levels more completely. Since emergy analysis (EmA) considers quality differences among diverse categories of energy, materials and money, as well as the environmental contribution to economic activities, this work put forward an emergy-based combined approach and related indicators, which consider pollution emissions' impacts, for evaluating flue gas denitration systems comprehensively. Next, two flue gas denitration systems in China (the selective catalytic reduction denitration system (SCRDS) and the selective non-catalytic reduction denitration system (SNCRDS)), as study cases, were investigated using the proposed approach and indicators. It is found that (1) purchased nonrenewable input (NP) contributes most to their total emergy input (TE); (2) the emergy loss is main emissionsâ€™ impact; (3) the SNCRDS has higher environmental cost but lower economic cost than the SCRDS due to its smaller share of purchased input and lower treatment efficiency; (4) the SCRDS has much higher environmental loading than the SNCRDS due to its higher share of nonrenewable input; (5) the SNCRDS has higher sustainability level than the SCRDS due to its lower dependence on nonrenewable input. Generally the denitration technologies convert lots of purchased nonrenewable resources into the local environmental benefits in an unsustainable way, which could cause the depletion of nonrenewable resources and environmental emissions in other areas in the future. Finally, some suggestions are proposed, including replacing the reducing agent for the SNCRDS, promoting the regeneration of spent denitration catalysts, strengthening energy management, and emphasizing operation training of technical staff.",
        "Oxy-fuel power generation and carbon dioxide capture as a downstream process is a near-zero emission energy system. The captured carbon dioxide can be liquefied but carbon dioxide liquefaction process needs considerable amounts of energy. Liquefied natural gas plays an important role in natural gas transportation. However, its production is known as an energy-intensive process. In this study, a novel integrated process of liquefied natural gas production, oxy-fuel electrical power generation cycle and cryogenic carbon dioxide capture and liquefaction is proposed and investigated by chemical process simulators. Effective operating parameters of the process and its components are thermodynamically analyzed. In this regard, effect of the turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio, oxidant, oxygen and propane flow rates on the power generation and electrical efficiency of the oxy-fuel cycle, carbon dioxide liquefaction temperature and pressure and liquefied natural gas production rate are examined. The obtained results indicate that, the proposed process can be used to design of the actual plants with optimal operating performance. Specific power consumption of the liquefied natural gas process is about of 0.281â€¯kWh/kg LNG. Also, to verify the accuracy of the process performance, the exergy analysis was performed for the process and all of its components. Through this analysis the exergy efficiency of the oxyfuel power cycle and natural gas liquefaction process are gained 69% and 51% respectively. Economic analysis of the process shows that prime cost of the product and period of return are 0.299US$/kgLNG and 2.392 years respectively.",
        "The objective of this study is to identify, through motivating, inhibiting and facilitating factors, responses to institutional pressures on the relationship between biodiesel plants and family farming cooperatives via the Social Fuel Seal (SFS) in the South region of Brazil. This region is characterized by well-endowed family farming cooperatives. This paper adopts as theoretical lens the institutional theory. It is based on case studies involving qualitative research drawing results from four biodiesel plants with SFS certification and eight family farming cooperatives. The results indicate that the institutional biodiesel framework influenced the SFS-based relationships. This coercion mechanism led the plants to comply with the promotion of family farming via cooperatives. The plants seek legal legitimacy and opt to accept institutional pressures, primarily due to the guaranteed sale of all biodiesel produced via government sponsored auctions. Cooperatives are attracted by the receipt of the social bonus, seen as a prime motivating factor, which can be interpreted as an informal coercive pressure. Considering the context in which the plants and cooperatives are inserted, the SFS promoted changes in the sale of raw materials. It was also found that cooperatives facilitating factors are inversely related with plants inhibiting factors.",
        "The world today is facing challenging crises like depletion of fossil fuels and environmental pollution. Biofuels can be an alternative solution to fossil fuels. Iran hosts a variety of weather conditions and its soil can grow different types of plants suitable for production of liquid biofuels. In this regard, the present research is an in-depth attempt to explore the potentials of Khuzestan Province as an agriculture hub of Iran to produce liquid biofuels. The studied biodiesel sources included oilseeds, animal fats and fish wastes, and the sources of bioethanol were wheat, sugarcane, sugar beet, rice, barley, maize, alfalfa, potato, grapes, apple, date and other local citrus fruits including orange, grapefruit, sweet lemon, sour lemon and sour orange. Results showed that the province's production potential was 1.04â€¯Gl of bioethanol. A 5% addition of ethanol to gasoline (i.e. E5) can save 63.5â€¯Ml of gasoline throughout the province. The estimated biodiesel production from animal fat- and oil-containing products and fish wastes is about 56â€¯Ml in this province that can supply 2% of its total diesel fuel requirement. The estimated fat-based biodiesel production of Iran is 332.56 million liters. By adding the biodiesel production from oilseeds, Iran can produce 1.27â€¯Gl of biodiesel fuel. This amount can supply 4.2% of the country's total diesel fuel consumption. The results for bioethanol and biodiesel production show promising alternatives. As a result of sound management of agricultural residues, E5 (5% ethanol, 95% gasoline) for SI engines and B2 (2% biodiesel and 98% diesel fuel) for diesel engines can be commercially produced as they impose no modifications to these engines.",
        "This study addresses the difficulty in systematically and scientifically evaluating the comprehensive performance of low-carbon modified asphalt. Sixteen technical indexes were selected as evaluation indicators. The corresponding weight of each evaluation index was determined by the coefficient of variation method. The fundamental performance, environmental protection effect, and economic effect of low-carbon modified asphalt were analyzed systematically. A comprehensive performance evaluation system for low-carbon modified asphalt was established based on the efficacy coefficient method. Low-carbon modified asphalt using tourmaline anion powder was selected as an example for inspection. Its comprehensive performance was evaluated, and the optimal content of tourmaline anion powder was determined. The results showed that the comprehensive performance evaluation of low-carbon modified asphalt using tourmaline anion powder reflects well the actual situation, meaning that a comprehensive performance evaluation system for low-carbon modified asphalt based on the efficacy coefficient method is relatively reliable and useful. This study lays the foundation for the comprehensive performance evaluation and further application of low-carbon modified asphalt.",
        "Environmental performance is becoming increasingly important to organizational decision-making boards. As with other organizations, Higher Education Institutions concerned with environmental performance require tools to help develop appropriate policies and programs. Key Performance Indicators are typically a component of economic and financial decision-making. Defining Key Performance Indicators for relevant environmental aspects of an institution can be seen as a step toward integrating environmental issues into overall management. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to define environmental Key Performance Indicators for Higher Education Institutions with a robust Environmental Management System (International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certified or Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) verified), and this methodology is coupled with a validation system based on meta-performance evaluation indicators. The proposal is based on the relative significance of various environmental aspects and the degree of operational control that an organization has over each aspect. The methodology is developed to be easy to applied, minimum time and resource consumption) and integrate in an existent Environmental Management System. It starts with a standard procedure to define the organization allowing its application to any type of Higher Education Institution. Additionally, a list of over 140 environmental indicators, described and classified, is offered. An environmental unit, Escuela PolitÃ©cnica Superior de Alcoy (EPSA), of Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de ValÃ¨ncia, EMAS verified, is used as a case study. From the study, seven Key Performance Indicators are defined, and three of these are fully assessed. Energy consumption, waste management treatment, and greenhouse gas emissions are the key elements of these three indicators. Institutions with robust Environmental Management Systems have significant advantages in identifying relevant environmental aspects and defining goals to begin defining Key Performance Indicators. However, Environmental Management Systems do not themselves ensure that data are available, nor that they are of the quality desired. In the case study, additional resources are required to generate Key Performance Indicators to assess significant environmental aspects. Securing those additional resources would benefit both the Environmental Management System and the organizational decision-makers.",
        "This paper is based on the idea that the success of an environmental policy applied to the industrial sector is driven by cooperation between all parties involved, which represent both public and private actors. An innovative index to measure ecological industrial policyâ€”Industrial Environmental Sustainability Index (IESI)â€”was designed using the Principal Component Analysis model, implemented through variables identifying both the applied strategy of the involved actors, on a sample of 20 Italian regions. The index allows vertical comparison among the regions in order to evaluate the achievements of national sustainable industrial policy. Its two sub-indexes also enable horizontal comparisons within the regions to encompass the role played by public and private actors. This provides a decision making support tool for policy makers seeking to fulfil their sustainability responsibility effectively, according to the EU directives.",
        "The steady growth in major development projects suggests that firms will increasingly need to respond to more stringent environmental determinations and project approvals. Accordingly, this article positions offsets as a mechanism for integrated environmental planning and management in response to development impacts. The study uses a stakeholder analysis methodology to identify and explicate the environmental planning and management practices that can be delivered by offsets, while demonstrating how firms and governments may use offsets as a tool to plan and manage environmental conservation and protection. However, despite our positive expectations, the research found that the current framework of offsets rules, regulations and supporting infrastructure requires changes if effective planning and management of the environment is to be facilitated through the offsets mechanism.",
        "Fuel poverty is a recognized and increasing problem in several European countries. A growing body of literature covers this topic, but dedicated analysis for Portugal are scarce despite the high perception of this condition. This paper contributes to fill this knowledge gap focusing on a European southern city while bringing new datasets and analysis to the assessment of this topic; consumer groups identification and to policy discussion. Daily electricity smart meters' registries were combined with socio-economic data, collected from door-to-door surveys, to understand the extent and the determinants of energy consumption for two contrasting consumer groups (herein called fuel poverty and fuel obesity groups). The analysis is based on the amount and annual profile of electricity consumption and was complemented with building energy simulations for relevant building typologies in those groups, to identify heating and cooling thermal performance gaps. The existence of these gaps allowed confirming and/or discarding the initial hypothesis of the poverty or obesity conditions. Results disclose socio-economic variables, as income, and consumers' behavior as key determinants of electricity consumption. It was identified a severe lack of thermal comfort levels inside households of both groups, either in cooling (98% for fuel poverty and 87% for fuel obesity) and heating seasons (98% for fuel poverty and 94% for fuel obesity). Major conclusion refers that electricity consumption cannot be used alone to segment consumer groups. This assessment may serve to support energy policy measures and instruments targeted to different consumers' groups. For example, distinct campaigns and differentiated incentives may apply to achieve energy efficiency and reduction while keep or improve indoor comfort levels.",
        "China is now faced with severe environmental pollution and energy scarcity. Targeted measures with regard to industrial and regional heterogeneity are essential for a â€œgreenâ€ transformation. Energy consumption in China's light industry sector exceeded 300 million tons of standard coal equivalents in 2014, accounting for 8% of total energy use and almost the same as South Korea's total energy consumption. Based on the data of 30 provinces from 2005 to 2014, this paper used meta-frontier method to investigate technology gap in energy utilization in different regions. The main findings are that the eastern region has the most advanced technology, and promoting dissemination of new technology from the eastern to the central region can be effective. Also, infrastructure construction and public services related to energy conservation should be prioritized in the western region. Low labor cost in the central and western regions contributes to a large proportion of SMEs, which threatens the promotion of new energy conservation technology. The inadequate financing system for SMEs worsens the situation.",
        "The present research explores whether carbon labels are an appropriate and effective tool for increasing climate-friendly food consumption in Europe. Using a mixed methods approach which combines choice experiments and a questionnaire with qualitative face-to-face interviews, the preferences and willingness to pay for carbon labels and claimed climate-friendliness are explored in six European countries. Our results show that the presence of a carbon label increases the purchase probability and that consumers are willing to pay a price premium of up to 20% for a carbon label in all countries included in the investigation. Regarding the design of a carbon label, a combination of a horizontal scale in traffic light like colors with an absolute number of CO2-equivalents is preferred. But consumers are willing to pay higher price premiums for local products than for carbon labeled products in most study countries. They tend to subsume climate-friendliness together with local and/or organic production under the umbrella terms 'eco-friendly' and 'ethical behavior'. Since they lack knowledge and problem awareness with respect to climate-friendly consumption, consumers are frequently overstrained with respect to climate-friendly buying decisions. Consumers expect policy makers and retailers to set up appropriate structures to support climate-friendly consumption. Given this, the contribution of a carbon label to a more climate-friendly consumption might be limited without the structural support of policy makers and retailers.",
        "Fuel upgrading is one of the globally requirements due to struggle the environmental impacts and to protect the humanity. Presence of oxygenated compounds such as phenol in liquid fuel caused serious problems in the fuel combustion and gums formation in the interior engines and consequently blocking the fuel filter. These problems are directly affected on both of the human's life and environment. Herein, functionalized viscose fibers were designed and applied for liquid fuel purification from phenol. Viscose fibers was firstly cationized by interaction with N-2-chloroethyl N,N diethyl ammonium chloride to produce cationized fibers with nitrogen contents of 0.32â€“0.52%. Sorption of phenol from n-octane by using the cationized fibers was systematically studied. Sorption capacities were significantly affected by the degree of substitution and were linearly increased with nitrogen contents. The maximum sorption capacities were 178.6 and 206.2â€“282.5â€¯mg/g for untreated and cationized fibers, respectively. Sorption was obeyed to pseudo-second order and signified that cationization process accelerates the phenol removal process. Sorption of phenol onto fibers were well followed Langmuir isotherm profile which reflected the monolayer sorption. Sorption was taken place via weak interactions between phenol molecules and substituted functional groups of fibers achieving physisorption process. However, the maximum capacity was diminished by regeneration process, the maximum removal of phenol was 80% after 4 regenerated cycles. Cationized viscose fibers can be considered as quite good template to purify liquid fuel from phenols, able to apply several times with good economic viability.",
        "Whilst low or zero carbon buildings (L/ZCBs) are espoused in many policy instruments, with many examples constructed to demonstrate their technical feasibility, there is a scarcity of effort examining the role of business models (BMs) in the delivery of L/ZCBs. BM innovation plays a decisive role in improving a company's competitiveness because it could quickly convert emerging technologies into commercial values by reorganising company's internal structure and offers. This paper aims to identify the factors influencing construction firms' BM innovation in the context of L/ZCBs, and measure the relationships between BM innovation for L/ZCBs and its influencing factors. This paper first identifies the influencing factors of BM innovation for L/ZCBs at both external and internal organisation levels and conceptualizes the constituting elements of BM innovation through a critical literature review. The paper then conducts a questionnaire survey with 132 building professionals in Hong Kong, and analyses the collected data using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Results from the survey show that favorable external environment towards L/ZCBs has a positive impact on BM innovation. Entrepreneurship of top managers and organisational learning capability of a firm are positively correlated with BM innovation for L/ZCB. Entrepreneurship and organisational learning capability mediate the relationships between external environment and BM innovation. The paper provides novel insights for building developers, contractors, and designers that wish to develop alternative business strategies and BMs. Research findings provide practical guidances on the process and elements of BM innovation for industry practitioners, and support the accelerated diffusion of L/ZCBs.",
        "With small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) being responsible for a significant proportion of global pollution, there are increasing calls for this type of businesses to engage in â€˜sustainable business practiceâ€™. However it is still unclear what this term actually means in day to day operations. This study identifies key characteristics of sustainable business practice for SMEs through evaluating the experiences of senior decision makers from 13 companies engaged in lean and green practices in Queensland, Australia. Through a systematic literature review and an exploratory study, nine characteristics emanating from the three themes of environmental stewardship, process excellence, and sustainability oriented-culture were established. Furthermore, this study build on natural-resource-based view (NRBV) theory to present a â€˜Natural Resources Based View Plusâ€™ (â€˜NRBV+â€™) model that includes an additional strategy of â€˜regenerative developmentâ€™. These findings can immediately assist SMEs to evaluate their practices, and in doing so, identify sustainability performance improvement opportunities. It is proposed that these findings also have implications for addressing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal of responsible consumption and production.",
        "The increased standard of living in our society has raised the level of concern regarding ecosystemic degradation of natural resources due to a greater demand for goods and services. In fact, noise, air pollution and traffic congestion are the main environmental concerns when we consider transportation externalities. Thus, in the European Union, 30% of the population is exposed to noise levels greater than 55â€¯dB, being road transportation responsible for 93% of the environmental costs produced by transport. Similarly, European Commission has calculated that the costs from road and rail traffic reach the amount of â‚¬40 billion per year in Europe. Sometimes this collective distress is not translated into individual actions for the reduction of environmental impact. Therefore, there has been an increasing use of social and psychological models to explain individual behavior towards the environment. Specifically, this study makes use of an extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) which includes personal values to determine the influential variables in willingness to pay (WTP) for the reduction of noise pollution generated by road transportation. Thus, we have applied a Structural Equation Model (SEM) in the European Pyrenees region (located between Spain and France), an area with high traffic pollution due to road transport. The results highlight the importance of psychological aspects in contamination actions and show that positive attitudes towards the environment and adequate perceived behavioral influence can increase WTP. Moreover, there is an indirect effect of biospheric and altruistic values on WTP by means of other variables such as the perceived behavioral control. Therefore, public performances and educational policies that improve environmental sensitivity and reduce environmental impact could help to achieve a collective effect on the environment and a unified struggle in favor of environmental protection.",
        "Although much research has been done to investigate the influence of regulatory and customer pressure on green innovations, the existing literature paid little attention to the question of how such pressure motivates organizations to improve their green innovation performance. A conceptual model based on the concept of green organizational responses is developed in this paper. The model is tested using structural equation modeling on a sample of 427 manufacturing organizations in six provinces in central China. The results of modeling show that regulatory and customer pressure promotes green organizational responses and enhances green innovation performance. However, these two forms of pressure are shown to have different impacts on specific organizational responses and different extent of impact on green innovation performance. For example, while regulatory pressure has significant positive impact on training and plays a direct role in green innovation performance, customer pressure has significant positive impact on research and development investments and collaboration networks. These results offer important implications for promoting green innovations in the manufacturing industry.",
        "Many energy efficiency professionals have proposed using Energy Performance Contracts (EPCs) as a mechanism to improve public sector energy efficiency in countries with restrictive government budgets. However, in practice, most middle-income countries have used this mechanism only in a limited way. Russia offers an interesting case study because of its huge energy savings opportunities, increasing energy prices, robust political backing for public sector energy efficiency, and evolving legislation that supports EPCs. In 2009, the Russian Federation initiated reductions in the country's energy intensity, including of the large public sector, which accounts for 9 percent of Russia's total energy consumption. To achieve energy efficiency goals in the public sector, Russia experimented with its public procurement rules, adjusting them to encourage EPCs. We reviewed the Russian government's official public database, conducted structured interviews with Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) in Russia and supplemented them with online research. Even though this process might not have captured all of the EPCs signed in Russia as of mid-2013, we estimate that nearly 50 ESCOs signed about 150 contracts in public facilities. Most ESCO contracts in Russia are for 5 years, and they generally are small (under $100,000). ESCOs in Russia face a challenging environment, which leads to smaller projects. ESCOs also are concerned about costly and risky tender procedures, uncertainty regarding repayment from public facilities, the inability to expand projects, and financing. We discuss these challenges and propose potential solutions at policy and company levels. The ESCOs feedback regarding Russia's experimental model can inform the country's program for public sector energy efficiency and offer lessons for other countries attempting to develop the EPC mechanism.",
        "To solve the insufficiency of biomass supply in the biomass power industry of China, this study developed a conceptual model of farmers' risk perceptions on straw supply (FROSS) activities by integrating influencing factors, namely, socio-demographic characteristics, policy guidance factors, economic factors, and trust factors, into the model (Wang, 2015). The FROSS model was empirically tested in a survey on the risk perceptions of 275 farmers living around a biomass power plant in northeast China. The results of multiple regression analyses on the influencing factors indicate that the proposed model accounts for 67.4% of the variance in farmers' risk perceptions. The factors that dominantly influence farmers' risk perceptions were then identified, after which factor analysis that was conceptualized along personal- and environment-related risk perceptions was carried out. The influencing factors predict more than 80% of personal-related risk perceptions but only 16.2% of environment-related risk perceptions. Focusing on the initial stages of analyzing the factors that affect farmers' risk perceptions regarding straw supply activities improves our understanding of straw demand risks in China's biomass power industry. The implications of the results are discussed.",
        "Even when restricting our observations to the business context, it is evident that the concept of sustainability is interpreted in quite different ways, which hinders the achievement of sustainability transitions. Approaching sustainability as an â€˜essentially contested conceptâ€™, this paper unpacks it into three constituent, management-relevant dimensions â€“ scope, substitutability, and goal orientation â€“ and demonstrates how different conceptions within these dimensions result in hugely different, often incompatible, yet legitimate interpretations of sustainability, with significant consequences for management and with significant differences in their outcome promise. The end result is a novel typology for categorizing conceptions of sustainability into eight basic types. The theoretical value added of the analysis lies in the fact that it improves clarity around a key concept, adds structure to debates on sustainability in a business context, and is able to build a common frame of reference without having to select a single common definition for sustainability. The findings can help with strategic, operative, and communicational problems that practicing managers face with regard to sustainability. Researchers and managers are encouraged to be explicit about the conceptions of sustainability they themselves adhere to and show awareness of those of others. This will, in turn, improve future research on business sustainability and future management of sustainable businesses alike, thus enhancing our ability to contribute to the building of a more sustainable society.",
        "The transition to green economies has been mediated by concrete cases and experiments in a variety of different industrial and social sectors. What is lacking, is research that would synthesize key findings and â€œlessons learnedâ€ across a variety of cases. In this study, we explore ten cases of green economy of different sectors and approaches from five European countries and identify factors that have had critical importance for the success or failure of the cases. Our paper reveals similarities across small and large scale cases and different approaches for implementing green economy. We identified critical factors related to economic viability, public funding, technological development, impact assessments, public policies and regulation, social capital, leadership and coordination as well as public acceptability and image. According to our results, transition to green economies requires negotiation between potential trade-offs among multiple goals, and interests of various stakeholders. The mutual benefits can be communicated through valid impact assessments and the integration of R&D into the practical implementation. Securing the continuity of funding and leadership is crucial in successful experiments and attention should be paid to fostering social capital among stakeholders. Instead of any single critical factor, the practical implementation of green economy is related to a multiplicity of factors and causalities depending on the context. The challenges with the practical implementation of green economy can only be met with patient, careful and far-sighted planning of green economy initiatives as well as continuous learning from past experiences.",
        "Production activities of modern economies are ultimately sustained by depletion of non-renewable fossil fuels. In the perspective of non-renewables displacement, an accurate evaluation of energy embodied in goods and services is crucial in order to select among alternative products or policies. Economic-based Input-Output models are widely used for this purpose: however, due to the increasing amount of international trades of products, definition of appropriate methods to account for the energy embodied in trades is nowadays crucial. In this paper, international trades treatment methods in Input-Output analysis are comprehensively formalized and applied to a case study based on the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). Energy embodied in final demand and in detailed products of key national energy sectors have been evaluated for the WIOD countries according to Single-Region and Multi-Regional models. It is found that an inappropriate use of international trades treatment models may produce very inaccurate estimations of numerical values of embodied energy. Three country groups has been identified, characterized by different ranges of fractions of imported/exported primary fossil fuels: Single-Region method A returns best results for countries of Group 1, with high values of fossil exports and low values of fossil imports; Multi-Regional method C is to be preferred for countries of Group 2, with high values of fossil imports and low values of fossil exports; finally, Single-Region method B returns lower deviations compared to other methods for countries of group 3, with low values of fossil imports and exports. This paper aims at supporting researchers in the field of Life Cycle Assessment in the application of Environmentally extended Input-Output analysis, finding the best trade-off between the efforts due to data collection and the accuracy of results.

        "For the last ten years, the notion of a green economy has become increasingly attractive to policy makers. However, green economy covers a lot of diverse concepts and its links with sustainability are not always clear. In this article, we focus on definitions of green economy and related concepts and an evaluation of these concepts against the criterion of strong and weak sustainability. The article serves three purposes: Firstly, we identify and describe diverse theories, concepts, approaches and tools related to a â€œgreen economyâ€. Among these are the theories of environmental economics and ecological economics, the concepts and approaches of cleaner production, waste hierarchy, bio-economy, industrial ecology, circular economy, nature-based solutions, and dematerialization through product-servicizing, and tools like life cycle assessment, and cost-benefit analysis. Secondly, we develop a framework that shows the capacity of the green economy concepts, approaches and tools to support the transition towards sustainability. Such a framework can serve as a heuristic to embed diverse concepts and approaches into a green economy framework. Thirdly, we briefly discuss green economy concepts with respect to their impact on strong and weak sustainability. Depending on the different concepts, approaches and tools identified in the green economy framework, different degrees of substitutability and trade-offs between environmental and economic benefits are allowed, and more or less structural changes of our modes of living are required. By discussing the notion of green economy and related concepts, approaches and tools we seek to make a contribution to their definitions and relationships as a prerequisite for operationalizing green economy.",
        "The aim of the study is to present a developed bottom-up-based methodology for predicting the energy performance of residential stocks on the neighbourhood and city scales. This methodology enables predicting the energy demand and discomfort hours (heating and cooling) taking into account urban and building factors such as urban block type, street height-width ratio and solar orientation of the main faÃ§ade, and shape factor and year of construction of the building, respectively. For this purpose, a four-staged methodology consisting in (1) urban taxonomy characterisation, (2) energy performance assessment, (3) statistical modelling and (4) stock aggregation is proposed, which combines building physical modelling and statistical inference in a Geographical Information System environment to provide an intuitive visual interface that represents final results on urban energy maps. The methodology was implemented in a medium-sized Spanish Mediterranean city as a case study, which allowed estimating the passive energy performance of a neighbourhood and setting building and urban design strategies. Results allowed concluding that the intrinsic parameters of the urban morphology play an important role on passive energy performance and important energy demand savings can be achieved when considering morphological urban aspects in new planning developments. This methodology is an efficient tool that can help stakeholders and local authorities in decision-making processes that focus both on developments of new urban areas taking into account energy requirements and on identifying and prioritising existing residential stocks in need of rehabilitation in energy terms.",
        "In Germany, energy costs for small and medium-sized enterprises are increasing despite declining power prices on the European Energy Exchange (EEX) resulting from levies, surcharges, and taxes. In order to reduce energy costs in manufacturing companies, the self-supply using renewable energies is becoming a viable option for an increasing number of companies. This article therefore uses a case study approach to investigate whether the investment in renewable power plants for (partial) self-supply could be financially beneficial. Using a specifically developed simulation, scenarios have been created to show various energy supply options to satisfy the energy demand of a medium-sized manufacturing company. The scenarios range from a complete energy supply obtained from an external provider to the other extreme of a complete and therefore autarkic supply from a virtual power plant (VPP). All scenarios work with a balanced demand and supply, at 15-min intervals over a period of one year during which demand is the determining factor. The scenarios are based on real case data for energy demand, measured local weather data, and realistically calculated data for the VPP. Depending on the scenario, the proposed VPPs consist of power plants using wind, solar, and biomass as primary energies, and thermal and electric storage. The results show that compared to the full provision of energy through a local energy provider, adopting a partial self-supply of renewable energy is a very attractive option in financial terms.",
        "Corporate sustainability challenges organisations with tensions between complex economic, environmental, and social issues. We draw on concepts in the innovation literatureâ€”namely exploration and exploitationâ€”to examine corporate sustainability practices as well as the ensuing tensions between efficiency and innovativeness in achieving organisational performance. In particular, this paper draws upon institutional theory to enhance the understanding of sustainability-related phenomena, mainly from a perspective that has not yet been widely investigated in prior empirical studies. Therefore, the paper addresses the research question of whether sustainability exploitation and sustainability exploration practices are characterized by an organisation's country of origin. The target respondents of a large-scale web-based survey were manufacturing and service industry targets distributed across five countries: Germany, Poland, Serbia, Slovenia and Spain. Multiple regression with categorical predictors (dummy variables) was utilized to examine country effects on each of the performance measures. The outcome of the regression analysis provides some evidence that organisations based in different countries may have substantially different perspectives regarding the achieved levels of organisational performance as a consequence of deploying sustainability practices. In general, the results suggest that organisations in different countries show more differences in relation to sustainability practices and organisational performance compared to organisations within the same country. The findings of this paper contribute to the research on corporate sustainability by differentiating two aspects of corporate sustainability practices, namely exploitation and exploration, and by suggesting that institutional mechanisms may be a plausible explanation for differences in the deployment of sustainability practices and the effects of sustainability practices on organisational performance. Therefore, the paper contributes to the literature by providing more clarity and better understanding of how organisations may pursue sustainability practices to gain performance benefits.",
        "Based on the theory of total factor production, this paper analyzes energy efficiency in China's textile industry at the regional levels using non-parametric meta-frontier approach and a provincial panel data during the period, 2000â€“2012. We further analyze the regional differences in energy utilization technology gap using the technology gap ratio. Irrespective of the frontier (meta or group), the empirical result depicts a tremendous energy saving potential in China's textile industry. Relative to meta-frontier, the average energy efficiency of China's textile industry is 0.673 during the sample period; hence, the energy saving potential is 32.7% if output remains unchanged. Relative to group frontier, the average efficiency of China's textile industry is 0.797, which may overestimate the true level of energy utilization. From the regional perspective, significant differences exist in energy technology within the textile industry. During the sample period, the energy utilization technology gap ratio (TGR) of the Textile Industry in eastern China remains above 0.95 and it's steadily improving, approaching the optimum for the whole textile industry. Moreover, the textile industries in central and western China have improvement potentials of 19.6% and 27.4%, respectively. Finally, based on the results from the regional energy efficiency analysis, future policy priorities are suggested.",
        "There is an expectation that the insurance sector should be leading business efforts in responding to climate change due to their inherent exposure to increasing risks. However, insurance companies normally operate on a one year time horizon - underwriting risks through policies which change each year to reflect new knowledge of these risks. The ClimateWise principles is a voluntary initiative of the insurance sector that was launched in 2007 to provide a basis for insurance companies to engage with climate change risks. This paper introduces the ClimateWise initiative and explores progress made since its launch. The paper presents new knowledge on whether this voluntary initiative provides a useful structure for the insurance sector in responding to the challenge of climate change. It finds that while the insurance sector has engaged with climate change, there is much more to do and we welcome the recent changes to ClimateWise that more accurately reflect this. The paper concludes that ClimateWise has been a useful initiative for the insurance companies and as a potential benchmark for the sector it offers some value. However, ClimateWise has not provided a strong enough engagement across the sector to embed climate action into business decisions.",
        "An information transition gap exists between cleaner production and sustainable consumption. A previous study shows that adequate product-level sustainability information should be available to consumers. A set of product-level sustainability attributes that capture influencing factors to facilitate sustainable consumption behavior have been proposed. However, the weight of each attribute needs to be determined when these attributes are applied to a specific industry. Therefore, this study aims to further develop a configuration model for the automobile industry by using the knowledge of Italian experts. In this study, semi-structured interviews of experts were conducted, and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was applied to collect data for determining the weights of attributes. The data was analyzed by using an AHP software called Super Decisions. This study is the most important step in obtaining accurate weights of attributes in a specific industry from experts. The individual result of each case and their aggregate results regarding the prominence of attributes have been obtained. This configuration model integrated the social and environmental impact of a product for the first time and aims to provide this information to consumers. Furthermore, in the context of a specific industry, the weight of each attribute was provided to further develop an information transition tool to facilitate sustainable consumption. The proposed model is expected to contribute to the studies of developing an information transition approach to promote sustainable consumption and production.",
        "The search for energy efficiency is an increasingly important requirement in the construction or renovation of residential, tertiary and commercial buildings. This requirement imposes the implementation of effective strategies for evaluating energetic performances. However, most of the literature works focused on the use of analytical approaches which sometimes proves insufficient, in the absence of taking into account the practical realities. This paper presents a methodology of risk analysis and assessment for efficient performance of buildings using the knowledge capitalization and exploitation from experience feedback processes. The target buildings (residential, tertiary and commercial) are chosen in the airport area of aeronautic context in which the lessons learnt are generated from the environmental assessment with the assistance of the main domain actors (experts, technicians and users). The effort is focused on identification of non-qualities and discomforts whose resolution could contribute to improving the energy and environmental performance of buildings. This approach integrates the collection of experienced knowledge from passive design strategies of sustainable buildings with innovative practices. Capitalization of knowledge from experience feedback processes will foster the development of proposals for preventive and corrective solutions and dissemination of good practices for solving problems regarding pathologies, damage, and other dysfunctions observed in the building field.",
        "Biodiesel, which comprises of fatty acid esters, is an alternative fuel for diesel engines. However, biodiesel has poorer cold flow properties (CFPs; i.e., cloud point (CP), cold filter plugging point (CFPP), and pour point (PP)) than diesel fuel. This study aims to reduce the PP, CFPP, and CP of two different biodiesels, namely, Cocos nucifera (coconut) and Calophyllum inophyllum (C. inophyllum), using polymethyl acrylate (PMA) additives. This study also investigates the effect of PMA on other biodiesel properties. Various physicochemical properties were measured and compared with the ASTM D6751 and EN14214 standards. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to observe the crystal behavior of the biodiesel blends. Results showed that 20% of biodiesel blended with diesel (B20) and 0.03Â wt% of PMA showed the highest improvement in the CP, PP, and CFPP. This study also investigates the influence of PMA on oxidation stability, flash point, heating value, and kinematic viscosity. These properties of B20 satisfy the ASTM D6751 and EN14214 standards. The process of crystal aggrandizement and the rate of wax crystal precipitation of B20 can be modified by PMA, resulting in enhanced CFPs of the biodiesel blend. Therefore, PMA is an effective cold-flow-improving additive for coconut-based and C.Â inophyllum-based biodiesel blends. Moreover, the results indicated that 20% coconut and C.Â inophyllum biodiesel blends with 0.03Â wt% of PMA can be used in cold climate areas without any problem in terms of fuel physicochemical quality.",
        "Several publications approach the subject of corporate sustainability performance, considering this background, the present research conducts a systematic literature review based on 261 papers towards a conceptual framework for integrating sustainability performance into business. Moreover, it aims at structuring the literature on corporate sustainability performance to highlight its main contributions and gaps. Data analysis initiates with a descriptive statistics of the sample, including yearly distribution, main journals, and most cited papers. It is followed by the delimitation of each sustainability performance approach of measurement, management and reporting and the cross analysis among them. Finally, a conceptual framework is proposed to address the integration of sustainability performance into business. This framework is composed by three levels. The first represents the principles for corporate sustainability to guide decision-making driven by collective values. The second level includes the core sustainable business elements, which are processes and practices, capabilities, offerings and contributions to sustainable development. At the third level, the context factors represent the internal and external aspects that affect the previous levels.",
        "In this paper, I address the call for a â€œnew approach to sustainability reportingâ€ (Lubin and Esty, 2014) based on the present â€œsustainability gapâ€ and propose the concept of â€œdigitally unified reporting.â€ This is achieved by reviewing two major trends from distinct bodies of literature: â€œintegrated reportingâ€ from the sustainability field and unified data based â€œXBRL-integrated reportsâ€ as established in financial reporting making use of the digital standard XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language). Based on a systematic literature review, eight trend statements are derived pointing at gaps and issues in the field of sustainability reporting and management. Following this review, I propose a new concept called â€œdigitally unified reportingâ€ that addresses these issues. The core contribution is an XBRL-based approach to sustainability reporting that combines digital data management of sustainability performance measurement with digitally standardized sustainability reporting. To advance theory, â€œdigitally unified reportingâ€ is defined and discussed and positioned as a â€œtwin track approachâ€ to sustainability reporting (Burritt and Schaltegger, 2010) that provides both an inside-out and an outside-in perspective on sustainability reporting and management. The major advancement and theoretical contribution of the proposed concept is a time-ontological shift due to 24/7/365 digital transparency. This proposed shift is from retrospective reporting on past performance to digitally enabled and interoperable real-time transparency of performance measurement and reporting for managers and external stakeholders. Finally, the concept is compared to current conventional reporting approaches.",
        "Much has been written about â€œwhyâ€ companies are involved in sustainability issues. However, relatively little research has addressed the integrative â€œhowâ€ question, particularly â€œhow companies can and do integrate sustainability assessment, management accounting, management control, and reporting?â€ Corporate sustainability, however, requires integrative measurement and management of sustainability issues rather than isolated applications of different tools in the organization. This article reviews literature dealing with links and partial links between sustainability assessment, management accounting, management control, and reporting. The main findings show that the various concepts (performance assessment, management accounting, management control, and reporting) are defined and used in various ways but mainly dealt within an isolated manner. Based on these findings this paper proposes a comprehensive, integrated framework of sustainability assessment, accounting, control and reporting. From a scientific perspective, the proposed framework is a first attempt to integrate these isolated concepts. It can help researchers and practitioners to better understand how the four concepts are related and could be linked to each other to develop an integrated approach.",
        "Sustainability reporting is a mostly voluntary activity that has gained great adherence in the corporate world. In examining the determinants of this activity research has focused on external company factors, providing mixed results. Hence, his study concentrates on internal factors by exploring how companies manage their sustainability reporting process. Using a qualitative research design we examine the internal factors that are associated with sustainability reporting of six Dutch companies with exemplary reports, as determined by two sustainability reporting benchmarking schemes. Additionally, the reports of the case companies are content analysed and their benchmark scores are scrutinised. Results demonstrate that, despite their top ranks in the schemes, the constellations of structures, systems and processes with which sustainability reporting is managed, varies across companies. Remarkably, for half of the sample companies sustainability (reporting) is not part of the day-to-day activities, but rather decoupled. Based on these findings, a typology of sustainability reporting is developed. The results also show that the quality assessment by the reporting schemes is inconsistent and that it is not possible to distil the reporting type from a company report. The results add to prior literature by giving insight into the internal factors underlying sustainability reporting, and how these factors interrelate. They imply that inclusion of internal organisational factors in sustainability reports will be valuable information to their users.",
        "Biomass is a renewable resource that has attractive characteristics for energy production, but the corresponding supply chain could be subject of several uncertain factors that can affect drastically the optimal configuration, and those have not been properly accounted in previous publications. Therefore, this work presents a new approach for the optimal planning under uncertainty for a biomass conversion system involving simultaneously economic and environmental issues. The environmental impact was measured via the Eco-indicator99 method and the economic aspect was determined through the net annual profit. The proposed method considered the uncertainty involved in the raw material price by the stochastic generation of scenarios using the Latin Hypercube method followed by the implementation of the Monte-Carlo method, where a deterministic optimization problem was solved for each single scenario to select the structure of the more robust supply chain relying on statistical data. The proposed approach was applied to a case study for a distributed biorefinery system in Mexico. The results showed that the behavior of the profit values for the stochastic case is not associated to the behavior of the raw material price; also, it is possible to observe thatÂ the supply chain topology could be affected for the uncertainty in the raw material price; however, the environmental and economic objectives did not present significant changes.",
        "The role of sustainability performance measurement, management accounting and control as well as sustainability reporting has been researched extensively. However this has been mainly done in an isolated manner. This Special Volume is dedicated to the question how to integrate sustainability assessment, management accounting, management control, and reporting. This Special Volume aims to advance our knowledge about how to integrate sustainability assessment, management accounting, management control, and reporting by nineteen state-of-the art and innovative papers. The main message from across the articles is that there is no one-size-fits-all approach and that we need creative, targeted and strategic approaches to integrate these different management areas, departments and rationales with the support of integrating accounting and reporting tools to help companies to become true transition leaders towards sustainability.",
        "Case study evidence from a large industrial firm is analysed with the purpose of constructing a new conceptual model of the influences that drive companies towards sustainability, and showing the advantages of integrating sustainability reporting with management control systems, specifically the balanced scorecard. The new conceptual model suggests an important role for external stakeholders to influence balanced scorecard measures, sustainability report measures, and management focus. These three constructs influence each other and are reinforced by a system of assigning and enforcing the assumption of individual employee responsibility, whilst supporting a drive towards sustainability. The advantages of integration include better operationalization and internal communication of sustainability ideals through the use of the balanced scorecard (BSC), and a better understanding of BSC causality (between the BSC perspectives) through the more extensive stakeholder engagement that sustainability reporting calls for.",
        "In this paper we use a form of discourse analysis to explore the â€˜activityâ€™ that three quite different sustainability reports set up as companies communicate their social and environmental performance. Our aim is to show what sustainability reports â€˜doâ€™ â€“ in order to offer insights about what they â€˜could doâ€™. We show that the companies are using sustainability reporting strategically, and that sustainability is embedded in to the company's strategic priorities. Where they mostly narrate and argue a point of view, sustainability reporting can offer additional benefits by transiting towards dialogue. Dialogue provides stakeholders with the means to engage substantially with companies, and also introduce new discourses that may open up new directions in how companies contribute to sustainability.",
        "Nowadays it is an important issue in refineries to increase the gasoline/middle distillate flexibility because of the ever-changing engine fuel demands. One possible way is the oligomerization of light olefins (3â€“6 carbon atoms). The oligomerization of the C4-C6 olefin content of light FCC and more fractions with different composition was investigated on acidic ion exchange resin catalyst and premixed catalyst bed. The favourable application temperature of the ion exchange catalyst was 120â€“130Â Â°CÂ (PÂ =Â 30Â bar, LHSVÂ =Â 1.0Â hâˆ’1). The olefin conversion was also influenced by the composition of the feedstock. The best olefin conversion was achieved in the case of the feedstock with the highest olefin content (olefin conversion: 91.5%, C12+ ratio: 31.2%). Similar results were found with the application of premixed catalysts (B and C) in more oligomerization steps. Olefin conversion and selectivity was depended on the olefin and C12+ content of the feedstock. The total olefin conversion (related to the olefin content of the FCC naphtha feedstock) increased with each oligomerization steps, but it has to be investigated that how many steps could be economic. In the long term experiment (110Â Â°C, 30Â bar, 1.0Â hâˆ’1) it was found that the conversion after 196Â h decreased approx. 10% (compared with the initial value) but it was significantly lower after 60Â h reaction time at 130Â Â°C. The examined ion exchange resinsÂ - in the 100â€“120Â Â°C temperature range - catalyze the oligomerization reactions for a long time, but an in-situ regeneration should be necessary.",
        "The industrial sector accounts for 35%â€“40% of total energy use in Sweden, where 30% of industrial energy use comes from non-energy-intensive small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This sector has not historically received much attention when it comes to improving energy efficiency due to limited resources, lower priority given to energy issues, rather small energy-saving potential for a single company, and great heterogeneity of the SMEs. However, the accumulative energy-saving potential for SMEs can be quite high and achieved at very low costs, partly because most improvements are found in support processes and are relatively easy to implement. Various public policies, such as industrial energy audit programmes, serve as a means for overcoming barriers to energy efficiency in the sector of SMEs. One example is the Swedish Energy Audit Programme (SEAP), a stand-alone audit programme functioning between 2010 and 2014. The aim of this paper is to examine the programme by means of process and impact evaluation. The results show that the programme resulted in annual net energy efficiency savings equivalent to 340Â GWh/year or 6% of the 713 participating companies' energy end use. The implementation rate in the audit programme was 53%. On average, the public cost of one implemented measure was â‚¬ 700. Derived from the amount of energy saved, the audit programme's annual cost-effectiveness is â‚¬7/MWh saved energy. This paper adds a significant scientific contribution due to the method used for evaluation. Multiple company visits and availability of quantitative data from 713 companies gave the possibility to address the additionality effects and estimate net energy savings more precisely.",
        "Business efficiency, stakeholder pressure and the need for legislative compliance compel the automotive sector to design and manufacture fuel-efficient, low-impact, environmentally responsible and sustainable vehicles. Managing and responding to these multiple and sometimes conflicting interests requires the measurement of economic, environmental and societal performance. Although a number of automotive sustainability measures are mentioned within the literature, there is no single and unique approach for the complete and integrated sustainability assessment of vehicles. This study has developed a comprehensive automotive sustainability assessment framework by selecting a set of sustainability assessment criteria from the literature and refining these through an interview study with 24 automotive experts from academia, car manufacturers, consultancies and non-governmental organisations. Based on this approach, 26 midpoint and 9 end-point environmental, resource, social and economic impact categories have been identified for the construction of a framework for automotive sustainability assessment. The proposed framework can be used as a decision-supporting tool at the early stages of the vehicle development process. It allows source and sustainability issues to be identified throughout the entire vehicle life cycle and provides the means to sharpen analysis and discussion around these issues. The framework can also serve as a design structure for a wide range of sustainability assessment methods and tools (e.g. multi-criteria decision adding or sustainability accounting methods). It serves as guidance on what needs to be measured in an integrated sustainability assessment of vehicles and leaves the choice of what to include in the decision-making process to the discretion of individual companies",
        "It is crucial for the industrial sector to achieve the multifaceted or composite efficiency of energy savings and the minimization of environmental wastes in the present circumstances of worsening global warming and resource depletion. Furthermore, the positive effects of composite energy efficiency on sustainable growth could lead to practical questions for the industrial sector, to ensure that it consistently uses its energy and resources effectively. The present research examines the positive contribution of this composite efficiency to the growth of final outputs in this sector, using the two-stage method of Malmquist efficiency analysis (MEA) and the linear regression of panel data from about 154 Korean industries from 2010 to 2012. The results found that composite efficiency and changes in the production factors have positive impacts on industrial productivity. In particular, relative efficiency has a positive influence on productivity, but technical efficiency does not have a significant impact. Our findings suggest that industries may voluntarily make efforts to improve their use of energy resources, but they also need to invest in energy technologies and develop efficient production structures, with the help of public policies.",
        "Many energy efficiency professionals have proposed using Energy Performance Contracts (EPCs) as a mechanism to improve public sector energy efficiency in countries with restrictive government budgets. However, in practice, most middle-income countries have used this mechanism only in a limited way. Russia offers an interesting case study because of its huge energy savings opportunities, increasing energy prices, robust political backing for public sector energy efficiency, and evolving legislation that supports EPCs. In 2009, the Russian Federation initiated reductions in the country's energy intensity, including of the large public sector, which accounts for 9 percent of Russia's total energy consumption. To achieve energy efficiency goals in the public sector, Russia experimented with its public procurement rules, adjusting them to encourage EPCs. We reviewed the Russian government's official public database, conducted structured interviews with Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) in Russia and supplemented them with online research. Even though this process might not have captured all of the EPCs signed in Russia as of mid-2013, we estimate that nearly 50 ESCOs signed about 150 contracts in public facilities. Most ESCO contracts in Russia are for 5 years, and they generally are small (under $100,000). ESCOs in Russia face a challenging environment, which leads to smaller projects. ESCOs also are concerned about costly and risky tender procedures, uncertainty regarding repayment from public facilities, the inability to expand projects, and financing. We discuss these challenges and propose potential solutions at policy and company levels. The ESCOs feedback regarding Russia's experimental model can inform the country's program for public sector energy efficiency and offer lessons for other countries attempting to develop the EPC mechanism.",
